<p>Valentin was stationed near a swamp during the assault on Leningrad:</p>

<p>“Once I started adjusting, the adjusting procedure, a shell fell down. It
was a swamp, with everything shaking. So a German shell fell down and exploded.
The swamp started shaking and the bar fell down. What should I do? I crawled
over the swamp to the bar. I set it up, restoring the position. I heard the
sound “whish… bang!” A German shell fell next to me I was lying on the
swamp. Water overflew from the shell weight. The water was boiling because the
shell got hot from flying I prayed to God. That was my first prayer and it
didn't blow up. It didn't blow up. I crawled back. I did the adjustment using
the bar. That was all. Afterwards we breached the siege, almost breached the
siege, capturing Shlisselburg. And we saw and captured the German ammunition
depot and then we saw that many of the bombs had their fuses unscrewed. The
fused were unscrewed. That was done by the French Resistance”</p>



<p>As part of anti aircraft artillery, Valentin's job was to shoot down German
planes:</p>

<p>“Gun layer sent the shell straight at the dive bomber with a 0.5 ton bomb
sitting underneath. So they hit the bomb with direct laying. The plane fell
into pieced right above the battery. The pilot's arm fell down into his gun's
trench. We were surprised with the size of the arm, it was so big with a watch
on, the watch was still ticking”.</p>



<p>Valentin was wounded before the attack on Leningrad and could not leave the
battery so he fought with a bandage on his head. A photo of him manning a gun
while bandaged was used in newspapers and various propaganda campaigns but his
Jewish sounding name was never included:</p>

<p>“And so I stayed with my head bandaged. They stopped the bleeding quickly.
They took out a piece of shrapnel. That's why on all the photos… our regiment
commander visited us soon after…and some other bosses visited us too to see
how we were fighting…my photo with my head bandaged hit all the books… my
name was never mentioned in any of the books though. That's because
anti-Semitism was always raging much more in Leningrad than in Moscow,
especially during the war”.</p>



<p>He was demobilized after the war and later immigrated to Canada.</p>
