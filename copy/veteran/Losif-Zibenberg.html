<p>Iosif and his family were evacuated in 1941. His parents returned home while 
Iosif and his brother were drafted into the army. Between major battles, Iosif
 was often tasked with laying down cables for communications:</p>

<p><i>“We were shown a map. Go and provide communication from one point to
another one. We used to go by 2 men, we were not allowed to go by 
ourselves.”</i></p>



<p>Iosif first combat experience came during <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/203">The Battle Of Stalingrad</a> in
1942:</p>

<p><i>“In Stalingrad we used to be thirsty, and there was no way of getting some
water. We had to clean and eat snow instead of water. We were afraid to stick
out our heads. We had a rifle and a submachine gun. We put a helmet on a
bayonet and raised it up. The Germans thought that was a soldier's head. Bang!
They hit the helmet. Once, it happened near Stalingrad. We were 30 men in our
platoon, or 31. The next day only 18 survived. I was wounded near Stalingrad,
rather contused. The Germans threw shells and bombs and one of them hit close
to us. It was impossible for us to get to a hospital, because there was no way
doing it in the daylight. We waited for the night to come. At night we were
picked up and driven to a field hospital.”</i></p>

<p>Iosif recovered and fought in <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/210">The Battle of Kursk</a> in July 1943 and <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/206">The Battle of Prague</a> in May 1945.</p>



<p>Iosif's unit marched through Bratislava before joining the Prague Offensive 
and liberating the city. He was in Czechoslovakia when the war ended and was 
demobilized in 1947.</p>
