<p>Grigory Svirksy was born while his mother was traveling  between Ufa and Moscow.  He grew up in a  “typically working class” household near the ball bearing plant in Moscow where  his father worked.  Grigory was drafted  in 1939 when he was 18. </p>
<p>Initially Grigory was an air force mechanic.  He would eventually fly combat  missions as a gunner: <br>
  <em>“At the beginning of the war I was a mechanic, a  bomber mechanic.  Later on I started  going on missions. When your plane is in the air it would be weird to stay on  the ground. I started as an air gunner. I went on missions during the entire  war, until the war was over.” </em><br>
  Grigory’s  unit rarely stayed in one area. They were generally confined to the far  north, except for a few missions near Moscow.  <br>
  <em>“Afterwards I was transferred to the Northern  Fleet. I got to the Northern Fleet. The war there was tough, it was a horrible  skirmish, you see? We were fighting on the sea where there were ships with not  just one but ten guns they used to make a big gun.  Returning from missions I used to find 5 to  10 holes in my plane’s body, you see? I was lucky not to have had a scratch” </em></p>
<p>Grigory  stayed in the army for 7 years, being discharged in 1946.  He became a well known writer and academic,  specializing in World War Two, Soviet Jews, and social criticism.  He spoke out against Soviet policy and was  forced to leave the country in 1972.  His  books were banned 4 years earlier in 1968.   Grigory eventually settled in Tornto where he taught Russian Literature  at U of T. </p>
