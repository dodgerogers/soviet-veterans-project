<p>In 1941, Leonid initially stationed at an aerodrome near Donkov. He was
wounded in one of the first Nazi raids:</p>

<p>“Suddenly 3 German planes appeared overhead, the anti-aircraft artillery
guys must have missed them. They appeared from nowhere. It lasted minutes. They
bombarded the airdrome landing field, firing at the caponiers where the planes
were, and disappeared. It didn't last long. Several men were killed, and
several men got wounded. I was among those who got wounded. I wasn't severely
wounded. The surgeon told me that had the shrapnel hit 1 mm wider he wouldn't
know how I would have ended up. I just had a small scratch that gradually
healed.”</p>



<p>Leonid was trained as a sniper but transferred to the air force where he
served as a engineer, but also went on combat missions as a gunner:</p>

<p>“I went on missions as a gunner. As an armament engineer I used to have in
store incendiary bullets. I used them to fire at German planes. I wasn't a
sniper in the war. I went on missions to replace those gunners killed in
action. When we were short of personnel, everyone went on missions, subject to
the command permission.”</p>

<p>He analyzed intelligence photos leading up to the strategic bombing
campaigns around Berlin and was on the ground during The Defense Of Moscow in
the winter of 1941-42.</p>



<p>After the war, Leonid immigrated to Israel before eventually settling in
Toronto. He did extensive research into Jewish involvement in The Red Army,
which he published in a book called “Jewish Heroism At War”.</p>
