<p>Boris and his family were evacuated to Kazakhstan when the war began in 
1941. Once he was of age, Boris returned to Belarus and enlisted in The Red 
Army in 1944. He was initially stationed in a border detachment, fighting
 against <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/veterans/54">Vlasov's army</a>, Lithuanian Forest Brothers, and The Ukrainian 
Nationalist Organization (OUN). Boris' first action against Nazis came while he 
was looking for water in a small Belorussian village near Vasilishki:</p>

<p><i>“As it turned out a big paratrooper group had landed, 300 men dispersed
around all houses in the village hoping to stay until the night falls and
attack the rear of our troops. The band was liquidated and we were recommended
for medals.”</i></p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/204">The Battle of Konigsberg</a> in 1945, Boris' detachment was responsible for 
ensuring no German soldiers outflanked the Soviet troops attacking the city:</p>

<p><i>“Konigsberg was surrounded and attacked. The city was a major stronghold.
Our regiment did not participate in the attack though. Our task was to
 liquidate those who had been sent behind our front lines.”</i></p>

<p>Boris joined the <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/412">NKVD</a> after the war. He was 1 of 2 people to make it through 
training out of an initial class of 17. In 1948, Boris' was tasked with 
investigating POWs for war crimes at a camp near Minsk:</p>

<p><i>“There were 30, 000 POWs in the camp. I had to interrogate them about
their activities during the war. If they had not been involved in crime against
civilians killing or burning down we sent them to Germany. We were 50 or so 
investigators working in the camp.”</i></p>

<p>Boris found former Olympic boxer Paul Schwiefer in the camp and made him his 
assistant. He developed a reputation as a tough and thorough investigator:</p>

<p><i>“There was a newspaper article about me in '49. A general used to say 'you
get to Kravitz - you go to prison' If they were involved in punitive
measures… that was our task to find out. I remember interrogating a German. I
 asked him if he had been on the Russian front. He said 'No'. 'Where were you?'
'In Lemberg'. I didn't know a thing about Lemberg. I looked up a map - it
turned out to be Lvov. In '39 Lvov was part or the Soviet Union. He was a 
Burgomaster. The investigation revealed his crime and he was hanged in Minsk in
'48. They were tried by 'a Troika' The whole trial was performed by three
persons, Minister of State Security Lieutenant-General Tsunava, Republic
Prosecutor Bondar, and Central Committee Secretary Gorbunov. We reported cases
and they made their judgments - exile in Siberia for year or execution by
shooting, depending on the case reported”.</i></p>

<p>Boris left the army in 1950. He immigrated to Israel before settling in 
Canada.</p>
