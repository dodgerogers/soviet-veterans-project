<p>Isaak lied about his age and enlisted as soon as the war began in 1941. He
 was frequently sent on prisoner capture missions:</p>

<p><i>“3 of us, our task was to take down both guards. The guards were walking 
from side to side, meeting halfway, talking and walking to the other side. We
agreed to take both of them down when they were on the sides. My task was to
hide and watch. When the guards parted our guys attacked them with knives and
took them down. After that they walked into a dug-out, where they gagged one of
the Germans, and killed 2 or 3 other Germans”.</i></p>



<p>Isaak also participated in <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/201">The Defense of Moscow</a> from 1941-42 where his
 division suffered heavy losses:</p>

<p><i>“Many were killed near Naro-Fominsk, Staraya Russa and Moscow. Only bits 
and pieces remained of our division.”</i></p>



<p>Isaak's unit was part of the offensive that liberated Latvia in 1944. He was
wounded on the outskirts of <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/208">Riga</a> and learned about the end of the war in the 
hospital: <i>“On the 9th, in the morning I was on the second floor in the 
hospital when I heard a noise in the backyard “Victory! Victory!” I went
 out. I couldn't believe it was victory! We kissed each other, crying, dancing,
and hugging each other. It was such a joy and sadness. Medical personnel came
out and started dancing with the soldiers. Finally the hospital chief came to
us He officially announced the end of the war.”</i></p>

<p>He was demobilized and eventually immigrated to Toronto.</p>
