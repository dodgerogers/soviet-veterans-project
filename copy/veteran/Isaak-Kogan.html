<p>Isaak was 15 when the Nazis invaded. He enlisted in The Red Army as soon as
he was able and was sent to the 2nd Belarusian front in 1942:</p>

<p><i>“My feeling was that the more Nazis I killed the better it was for the
Soviet Union”</i></p>



<p>When his lieutenant had been shot, Isaak leapt out from the trench, ran 
towards the gunfire, and pulled the man to safety:</p>

<p><i>“My commander, a lieutenant was wounded. I saw him being wounded. I 
crawled up to him and dragged him to a trench. That's how it was - we saved his
life… The other one, the soldier who was with me was also awarded the Medal 
for Combat Merits. That's how it was”.</i></p>

<p>Isaak's service ended after less than a year at the front, when a German 
missile injured both his legs and lodged a small piece of shrapnel in his 
head:</p>

<p><i>“I fell into a ditch… next to two wounded men. Rather they were 4. 2 of
them died soon. I lay there for quite a while. I felt pain in my kidney. I was
 picked up and taken to a hospital”.</i></p>



<p>Isaak's injury forced him to spend 6 months in the hospital where he was 
medically discharged from the army. After the war, Isaak received a medal for 
saving his lieutenant: <i>“They didn't award me until some time later. Everyone 
was happy that we saved the commander that he survived. Such things didn't
happen too often”.</i></p>



<p>After the war, Isaak stayed in Ukraine and worked in a shoe factory near the 
Chernobyl reactor. Before immigrating to Canada, he contracted illnesses 
related to the radiation.</p>
