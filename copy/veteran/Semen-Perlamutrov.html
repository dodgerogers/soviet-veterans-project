<p>Semyon was in his first year of auto mechanic training when the Nazis invaded
 in 1941. He was drafted and sent near <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/200">Leningrad</a> on the western front:</p>

<p><i>"Leningrad was surrounded, there was a siege. Our task was to breach the
 siege. We didn't have a chance to breach the siege until 2 years later. Our
troops were attacking to breach the siege for 2 years. Finally after the
Germans were defeated near Moscow and Kursk, they became so weak that they had
to retreat".</i></p>

<p>Semyon worked in artillery: <i>"I was a private soldier, a plugman; I loaded 
shells into a plug. The division was equipped with small guns utilizing 3 kinds
of shells; armour piercing shells, fire shells putting tanks on fire and
 shrapnel shells targeting infantry"</i> Unable to break the Siege of Leningrad,
Semyon and the other soldiers would often sneak supplies into the city. He 
survived the winter but was wounded on March 10th 1942. After convalescing for 
6 months, Semyon was made a military driver and spent the remainder of the war 
transporting soldiers to and from the front lines.</p>



<p>Semyon worked as a mechanic in The Soviet Union before immigrating to Canada
in 1975.</p>
