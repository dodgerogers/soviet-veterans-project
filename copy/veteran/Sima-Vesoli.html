<p>Sima arrived at The 3rd Belorussian Front in 1943. Staying just a few
kilometers behind the soldiers, Sima and the rest of the medical staff were 
under fire on a regular basis:</p>

<p><i>“We were bombed and fired at. Many nurses were killed. Medical staff air
raid, it was so scary. We were saving the wounded soldiers all the same.”</i></p>

<p>Sima stayed with the soldiers for the rest of the war, reaching Berlin in
1945. </p>



<p>After the war in Europe, Sima was transferred to <a href=http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/209">North Korea</a>. Stationed 
primarily in Pyongyang, where she treated Japanese POWs in addition to Soviet
soldiers: <i>“Many Japanese soldiers were captured. They got a treatment which 
was better than the one our soldiers got [Soviets captured by Japanese]”</i></p>



<p>Sima was demobilized late in 1946. She worked in a bone tuberculosis clinic
for 30 years before immigrating to Canada.</p>
