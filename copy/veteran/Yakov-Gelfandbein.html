<p>Yakov was in
artillery camp near <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/200">Leningrad</a> at the start of the war. He was at a train
station when the Germans first bombed the city. Yakov's unit mobilized quickly
and were sent to a small town called Tappa in Eastern Russia. They were
positioned to intercept a group of Nazi planes:</p>

<p>"After a while we
heard the humming sound of airplanes and saw an armada of about 70 airplanes
approaching us from south-west. Then we saw them turning and approaching the
landing strip. However, the moment the first airplane signaled to light the
landing strip, a series of red flares came from under the bomb stack, and the
airplanes took off without landing and flew back to their airdrome. The
operation failed. The search for those who gave the signal didn't give any
result. However German submachine guns, gas masks and other equipment were
found under the stack"</p>

<p>Fearing the Germans
had learned their position, Yakov's unit moved to another small town called
Volosovo:</p>

<p>"The Germans were
hoping to manage a break through to Leningrad and to capture Leningrad by
storm. They spread themselves along the embankment, 3 km long. We decided that
the right-hand guns will fire one gun from tail to head, and the left-hand
howitzers will fire one gun from head to tail. So when they entered the 
embankment, there was a command to open fire. All the 70 tanks were destroyed
on the embankment. That was our response… that's how we saved Leningrad from
being captured directly".</p>

<p>SMERSH investigated
Yakov in the winter of 1941, after his unit fought through encirclement near 
Leningrad:</p>

<p>"I was
interrogated by SMERSH like everyone else. I proved that I was a Jew. My Jewish
passport had entries of my date of birth and the place the passport had been
issued</p>

<p>And so they trusted
me"</p>

<p>Yakov was
transferred to The Ukrainian Front after being cleared by counter intelligence.
He was wounded near Tula. After recovering Yakov was promoted to assistant 
battery commander and sent to the Stalingrad front.</p>

<p>Resources were
scarce during <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/203">The Battle Of Stalingrad</a>. As a commander Yakov was responsible
not only for hitting the target but choosing the most appropriate time to
fire:</p>

<p>"A German platoon
led by a corporal came out</p>

<p>One of them looking
like a real German pig got in the car and started playing a cheerful march
"Nach zu Est" - March to the East. And so when he played "Nach zu Est"
I commanded fire! 2 batteries of 24 guns, 2 seconds, running fire."</p>

<p>After Stalingrad
 Yakov participated in the Battle of Sevastopol. Red Army soldiers crossed a
river using discarded Nazi caskets as boats:</p>

<p>"They brought the
caskets to the northern side's bay. We captured the caskets in the evening.
Soldier's wisdom, captured the caskets and caulked them. Every casket cover
gave us an oar, because we removed the upper part. The lower part was caulked
and was used as a boat. This way we had 4000 boats and 8000 men. The Germans
realized they wouldn't be able to keep Sevastopol despite the fact that they
had kept it for 173 days. We captured it in 3 days."</p>

<p>Yakov continued
fighting as part of Operation Bagration, recapturing Belarus and Poland after
Sevastopol. His unit liberated Auschwitz concentration camp in January 1945:</p>

<p>"When we came to
Auschwitz we saw 2000 exhausted people, mainly women and children. We moved
them out, took them not far from Oppeln"</p>

<p>Yakov was in Poland
when the war ended. He became a scientist and worked on the Soviet Space
Program with Sergei Korolev before immigrating to Montreal.</p>
