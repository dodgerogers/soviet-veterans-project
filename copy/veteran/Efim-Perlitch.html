<p>"I had to fight on two fronts.
The first one was fighting against the enemy. And the second one was fighting
unit commanders."</p>

<p>Efim became a soldier at 14 after both of his parents were killed:</p>

<p>“In June, '41 I lost my parents during an air raid. We were on a train.
The train left leaving me on my own, without livelihood. That was dreadful. I
had to find myself a place to live. I joined retreating army units: I didn't
have any food or money. Joining the retreating army I got to Caucasus, where I
got my first combat experience liquidating enemy's motorized landing
party.”</p>

<p>The unit got into trouble in Caucuses:</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, I got surrounded along with a small military unit. We were
about to be executed by shooting. During the shooting the sergeant major pushed
me into the trench before they started… and after that he was wounded and
fell on me I asked him: “Are you alive?” He said: “I am alive, but I'm
wounded, I cannot move”. I said: “Let's get out of the trench before the
Germans come back”. I dragged him all the way through the night.”</p>

<p>They had to spend the night in a cornfield:</p>

<p>“Hiding in the corn field we managed to pelt the front cyclists with
grenades and stir a commotion. While I was dragging him away, he said: “Let's
revenge upon them for our comrades whom they killed. There's no other way for
us to go. It was in the night when he sent me to check out what was in those
vans. I crawled there. I saw guards walking along the vans. I crawled into a
van and found some barrels and straw baskets there. Being a boy, I took with me
a straw basket. It turned out to be full of grenades. When I started getting
out, I made a noise and right away I heard “Halt!” from the soldiers who
ran up to me. I dived under the van. It was dark. They searched around with
their lights and soon left. I crawled back, trying to locate my sergeant major.
I found him. “What did you see?” “I saw barrels”. “What else?”
“Here's a basket”. He put his hand in: “These are grenades!” And so we
crawled up. I was good at throwing grenades. I threw one at the first van. An
explosion took place. It turned out there were fuel barrels inside the
van.”</p>

<p>Because he was too young to officially join the army, Efim was sent to
Stalingrad after the incident in the cornfield. He joined the People's
Volunteer Corps and participated in The Battle of Stalingrad as part of that
militia:</p>

<p>“We crawled up via communication trenches. We started throwing grenades at
them. We made them fall down from the steep rock. There was an island in the
middle of the river Volga, named Denezhny. Our artillery fired at that island.
The artillery men were wondering who was there making the Germans fall from the
steep rock. Eventually they found out that it was us. For that heroism, I was
decorated with the Order of Red Star.”</p>

<p>Efim moved to Ukraine after the war and became an electrician. His wife
worked for the KGB, meaning it was against regulations or them to travel or
interact with foreigners. Efim was one of the first responders to the Chernobyl
disaster in 1986. He later moved to Montreal.</p>
