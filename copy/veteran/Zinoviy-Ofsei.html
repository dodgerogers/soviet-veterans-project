<p>"Big number of men to be operated on under difficult circumstances,
in the forest under a canvas, in the outskirts of a village, sometimes with
scarce lighting."</p>

<p>Zinoviy was finishing medical school when the war began in 1941. After the
First Battle Of Kiev, he and any other available medical personnel were taken
to the front by train. Upon arrival, Zinoviy was immediately made a senior
lieutenant and assigned to the 13th Guards division. The mass of wounded men
forced Zinoviy to work up to 10 hours in a row while compensating for a shortage
of supplies:</p>

<p>“Necessity is the mother of invention. We were operating under a canvass.
Our truck drivers used to arrange the lighting in an original way: they took a
truck headlight off with the truck motors running and fixed it inside the
operating rooms”</p>

<p>To maximize efficiency, Zinoviy's commander organized “mini medical
battalions” in late 1941. These groups consisted of 2 surgeons, 2 nurses, 4
attending, and a driver. These teams would drive close to the front and
administer aid, eliminating the need to transport soldiers while they were
wounded. On May 22nd 1942, Zinoviy was wounded while his battalion was returning
from the front:</p>

<p>“I was on the truck with the wounded soldiers when an air raid started,
the Germans fighters firing at us. Despite seeing the Red Cross on top of our
truck, German pilots fired at us”.</p>

<p>Both of Zinoviy's legs were seriously injured. He was medically discharged
from the army after 6 months in a hospital. Zinoviy was working at a walk in
clininc in Vilnus, Lithuania when the war ended: “I was about to leave for
work, I heard shooting in the street. People were shouting and shooting from
their guns. At first we didn't understand what was going on. When I went out to
Mindangasa Street I saw hundreds of people running to the Opera Theatre,
hugging and kissing each other. I asked, 'What's going on?' 'End of the war!
The Germans signed the capitulation. End of the war!' You can't imagine, nobody
worked that day”. Zinoviy maintained his medical practice in Lithuania before
immigrating to Canada.</p>
