<p>Feygin was drafted in October 1943:</p>

<p>“I was 17.5 years old. I was drafted to the army; it was just a regular
army draft. I got to Estonian reserve rifle regiment stationed in the Urals. I
stayed there for 3 months. As I had left during my third year at the
Communications College, I was sent to radio operators' platoon. That's where I
started learning the Morse code. In February we were transferred from the
regiment to Leningrad Front. That's where I, among others, was sent to 55th
Guards artillery brigade.”</p>



<p>Feygin was not involved in direct combat during The Siege of Leningrad. As a
radio operator he helped direct coordinate the artillery's firing positions:</p>

<p>“I was a radio operator. There were 2 radio operators' squads in the
platoon. They had 2 reconnaissance squads and 2 radio operators' squads. During
a combat one squad was at the regiment's look-out station and was directly
involved in fighting, while we did the correction of fire”.</p>

<p>Feygin was soon sent to Estonia, where he was on the front lines at Narva
and Balaton:</p>

<p>“The first combat I was involved in was the battle of Narva, Estonia,
close to the Russian border. It was an unsuccessful winter offensive. It
involved being exposed to direct fire. So the first one failed. The matter was,
the Germans were on the sloping bank of the river, while we were facing a
precipice. Therefore we had to get down in order to force a crossing over the
river. There is a town near Balaton, named Székesfehérvár where I was
contused. The combat activities near Balaton were very serious.”</p>



<p>After Estonia, Feygin's unit was formally integrated into Konev's Ukrainian
Front and went on to liberate Vienna:</p>

<p>“When we were near Vienna, our infantry units suffered great losses, very
few men having survived. To be honest the commanders didn't spare men. And an
airborne division was sent to reinforce our troops we joined the airborne
brigade, we had to learn to use the parachutes.”</p>

<p>He was close to Budapest when the war ended:</p>

<p>“It was 20 to 30 km away from Budapest. There was a convent there. Monks
were guarding the convent. One of the radio operators' squad went to the
convent where they found a beautiful garden with a beautiful vineyard, while
the other squad stayed here to maintain communications. That was where my army
service was finished”</p>



<p>Feygin worked as a teacher at a communications college in Kirov before
immigrating to Canada.</p>
