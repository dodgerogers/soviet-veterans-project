<p>Grigory's unit was part of the 2nd encirclement echelon that broke through 
German lines at <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/203">The Battle Of Stalingrad</a> in 1942:</p>

<p><i>“My unit was following the infantry men, firing direct fire. We managed to 
make a gap in the German defenses for our 4th Mechanized Corps to go through
 and to join, on November 23rd, the 4th Tank Corps, thus destroying the German
defenses. 22 German divisions and 320,000 officers and soldiers were 
surrounded”</i></p>



<p>Shortly after Stalingrad, Grigory was wounded and transferred to a different 
rifle regiment after he recuperated. He was now with the 49th Rifle Division
 under the command of General Marguelov. They fought in <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/207">The Battle of Budapest</a> in January
1945:</p>

<p><i>“Early in the morning, the German tanks made an attempt to break out, to
come to the aid of the Budapest garrison. There was a winding road there, with
 hills on the flanks. I focused my artillery gun. There were many artillery guns 
there. As soon as the German column started moving we started firing point
blank putting German tanks on fire”</i></p>



<p>Grigory served throughout Europe but is considers Stalingrad his most 
important contribution to the war:</p>

<p><i>“Even the Germans, and their commanders… admit in some publications…
that the Battle of Stalingrad became a grave for the German army. That was 
their grave. Before that the Germans were advancing all the time. Even in '42,
prior to Stalingrad they were advancing. At that time, in '42, 64th army was 
caught in a pocket. That was nearly the end of the 64th army. We saved it.
That's why I am proud to have been involved in that battle”</i></p>
