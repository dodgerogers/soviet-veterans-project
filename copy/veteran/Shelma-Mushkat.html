<p>Shlema was drafted in 1937. He was a commander on the western front, near <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/200">
Leningrad</a>, when the war with Germany began. Early in the war, Shlema was
wounded during a minor offensive:</p>

<p>“We started an attack in the night. I was wounded in the hip. I was taken
to a tent. I don't remember how I get to Gorky Region. Staying out of army was
worse. After the recovery I was out of the front. You walk into a store, 'Our
husbands are fighting at the front, why aren't you?' They didn't know that we
were injured.”</p>

<p>Shlema only away from the front lines for a few months, he returned to his
post on the western front as soon as he was able.</p>



<p>Shlema's unit was given The Order Of Glory for destroying a Nazi train near
Leningrad in the winter of 1943:</p>

<p>“An armoured train was running and firing at our position. I was ordered
to stop it. There was a swamp. The place was inaccessible for the horses. We
had to carry the gun on our shoulders. We stopped the armoured train.
Stopped…rather destroyed it.”</p>

<p>They were stationed away from where The Siege Of Leningrad was taking place.
Instead, they were tasked with holding the land still under Soviet control in
order:</p>

<p>“We took a defensive position. We didn't do anything, just holding a
defensive position. When attacked we fought off. Close to Leningrad, the 
Leningrad Front. When they attacked us, we fought back. That was the Leningrad 
Front.</p>



<p>Shlema also fought against Finland in <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/213">The Continuation War</a>, serving a t
Karelofinna and Vladivostok (contested territory with near Amur Bay) in
1944:</p>

<p>“We had hard time fighting against the Finns. The Finns used to come at
night throwing knives. They used to put down the guards with their knives. They
killed a lot of our soldiers. They gave us a hard time. They were skiers. The
temperature was 40 below zero, freezing cold.”</p>



<p>After the war, Shlema tried to start a business but was arrested for
profiteering:</p>

<p>I started a job and was “awarded” for good work with 27 years of
imprisonment 17 years in prison and 10 years in exile 'A Jew is a profiteer'. I
was lucky I was a Polish citizen. In '57 the government issued an order
allowing the Jews who had lived in Poland before the war to return to Poland. I
was transferred to and let go in Poland.</p>

<p>Shortly after his release, Shlema joined his brothers who were already
living in Canada.</p>
