<p>Shlema was drafted in 1937. He was a commander on the western front, near <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/200">
Leningrad</a>, when the war with Germany began. Early in the war, Shlema was
wounded during a minor offensive:</p>

<p><i>“We started an attack in the night. I was wounded in the hip. I was taken 
to a tent. I don't remember how I get to Gorky Region. Staying out of army was 
worse. After the recovery I was out of the front. You walk into a store, 'Our
husbands are fighting at the front, why aren't you?' They didn't know that we 
were injured.”</i></p>

<p>Shlema only away from the front lines for a few months, he returned to his 
post on the western front as soon as he was able.</p>



<p>Shlema's unit was given The Order Of Glory for destroying a Nazi train near 
Leningrad in the winter of 1943:</p>

<p><i>“An armoured train was running and firing at our position. I was ordered 
to stop it. There was a swamp. The place was inaccessible for the horses. We
had to carry the gun on our shoulders. We stopped the armoured train.
Stopped…rather destroyed it.”</i></p>

<p>They were stationed away from where The Siege Of Leningrad was taking place.
Instead, they were tasked with holding the land still under Soviet control:</p>

<p><i>“We took a defensive position. We didn't do anything, just holding a
defensive position. When attacked we fought off. Close to Leningrad, the 
Leningrad Front. When they attacked us, we fought back. That was the Leningrad 
Front.</i></p>



<p>Shlema also fought against Finland in <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/213">The Continuation War</a>, serving at 
Karelofinna and Vladivostok (contested territory with near Amur Bay) in 
1944:</p>

<p><i>“We had hard time fighting against the Finns. The Finns used to come at 
night throwing knives. They used to put down the guards with their knives. They
killed a lot of our soldiers. They gave us a hard time. They were skiers. The 
temperature was 40 below zero, freezing cold.”</i></p>



<p>After the war, Shlema tried to start a business but was arrested for 
profiteering:</p>

<p><i>I started a job and was “awarded” for good work with 27 years of
imprisonment 17 years in prison and 10 years in exile 'A Jew is a profiteer'. I
 was lucky I was a Polish citizen. In '57 the government issued an order
allowing the Jews who had lived in Poland before the war to return to Poland. I
was transferred to and let go in Poland.</i></p>

<p>Shortly after his release, Shlema joined his brothers who were already
 living in Canada.</p>
