<p>Even as a boy, Lazar wanted to join the army. He was too young to enlist
when the war began but enrolled in the academy as soon as he was able:</p>

<p><i>“They were eager to enlist in the army. I wasn't supposed to enlist before
 I was 17 years old. As I said, I was born in November. And in November a letter
came saying that at this time we would be permitted to enlist in the army. When
 we were told that we could go to the military commissariat to enlist, we ran
all the 30 km to the office. I finished the program with honours. They wanted
me to stay and serve as a junior commander. When I found out that they wanted
me to stay at the school, I went to see the school director and I told him that 
I strongly opposed to staying at the school. I didn't enlist in the army to
work as a school instructor. I wanted to fight against the Nazis”</i></p>



<p>In August 1944 Lazar got his wish and was sent to the 3rd Ukrainian Front 
with the 41st Guards Division, 124 Regiment. He was wounded in December:</p>

<p><i>“I was wounded in December '44, which was a minor leg injury I was 
recuperating fast. I asked them to send me there without even removing the 
bandaging from my leg.”</i></p>

<p>Shortly after returning to his unit, Lazar was made a platoon commander when 
he was just 18 years old. He lead the platoon through Ukraine and during the
<a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/207">Battle of Budapest</a>, distinguishing himself as a leader and a sniper:</p>

<p><i>“Before the dawn we saw that we were on a hill, while in the valley some
kind of grey mass was moving. We couldn't make out who it was. When they moved 
closer I used my binocular and sniper's rear sight to see German soldiers. We
opened fire. They fired back. They scattered over the valley. They started
 moving uphill. When they were far away from us I saw them going uphill. Someone
said to me: “Come on sniper, show us your sniper skills. I dug myself out a
small trench. The distance was about 800 m between me and the place where the 
figures of the Germans could be seen. That was where I shot down about 13 or 14 
men When I was shooting, I was surprised when after a shot the man didn't fall
down. I thought to myself: “Could it be that I missed?” It turned out that 
the men fell down 2 or 3 seconds later. That was when I realized that I had
 allowed for the time a bullet was flying”.</i></p>



<p>Lazar was demobilized in 1947. He went back to school in Ukraine and trained 
as an engineer. After graduating, Lazar worked in construction where he was
 awarded badges for Tashkent and Dagestan builder.</p>
