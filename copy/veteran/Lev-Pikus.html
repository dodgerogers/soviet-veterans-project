<p>Lev was only 12 when the war began in 1939 but immediately joined <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/410">the 
resistance</a>. He took advantage of his inconspicuous youthful appearance on 
reconnaissance missions:</p>

<p><i>“I would wear a big bag over my shoulder. Under the guise of a beggar I
walked places noticing what was there. I passed the information on to be
 processed and sent on to partisan detachments”</i></p>



<p>Walking around Brest and gathering information became Lev's main job during
 the war:</p>

<p><i>“I didn't know where the info I collected went further. My job was 
sniffing out, spying out and passing the info on. Every time my life was in 
danger. Anyone could shoot or beat me up”</i></p>



<p>Once a ghetto was established in 1941, Lev also as a liaison between the 
Jews and the resistance:</p>

<p><i>“When the ghetto was organized we would come there to pick up medications 
for the partisans. I was just 14 at that time, going on 15. They would protect 
me, keep me from involvement in dangerous missions. I was too young for that. I
was a thin and weak boy because I was undernourished.”</i></p>



<p>Lev eventually settled in Toronto.</p>
