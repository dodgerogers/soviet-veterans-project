<p>Yevgeniy was a mechanic in the famous Normandie-Nieman Regiment. Formalized
in 1943, the unit was a partnership between France and The Soviet Union, with
French pilots initially stationed in Eastern Europe flying Soviet planes. They 
gradually fought their way west and participated in <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/202">The Battle Of Berlin</a>.</p>



<p>One night Yevgeniy was alone guarding the planes when the aerodrome was
 ambushed:</p>

<p><i>“That night the Germans attacked and fired at us. I was on my own at my 
post. I fired back all night, running from one place to another. I was trying 
to make the Germans think that I wasn't alone there. In the morning other 
soldiers came to help me fire back at the Germans.”</i></p>



<p>After the Second World War, Yeveginy was sent to train communist forces in 
China:</p>

<p><i>“When we were sent to China we were dressed as civilians. When we got to
China we trained, through interpreters, Chinese mechanics to operate the
aircraft. The Chinese were very good people. The treated us very well. They
were so grateful”.</i></p>

<p>He was demobilized in 1952 and worked as a wood turner in Rechitsa, Belarus 
before immigrating to Canada.</p>
