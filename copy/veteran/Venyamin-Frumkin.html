<p>Venyamin was at military college in Moscow when the war began:</p>

<p>“We were sent to the front right away. I was at the front. I had a big
position: I was regiment's engineer, just think of it, I was just a 20 or 19
year old kid. I wasn't exactly in a trench. I was in an arrears dugout with two
trenches in front of me. I remember sitting in a trench with my white
camouflage cloak on, as it was in the winter. It was an active defence on our
part. Our goal was to capture a “Yazyk”, a German prisoner who would talk.
We spotted a German machine gunner and brought down fire on both sides making
sure he couldn't escape. My sappers made a passage over a mine land surrounded
by barbwire.”</p>



<p>After the Defence of Moscow, Venyamin was given more advisory tasks related
to his engineering background. He commanded an artillery brigade, supporting a
tank unit during the Capture of Konigsberg:</p>

<p>“We accompanied a tank brigade, I was in command of the accompanying
company, the platoon commanders were in front. I was with our chief of staff in
the tank.”</p>



<p>Venyamin became an advisor to The North Korean Army after the war in
Europe:</p>

<p>“As an advisor I was involved in training and instructing them. They had
an army, with platoons and companies. They had a personnel arrangement similar
to what we had. We trained them how to fight. We had interpreters.”</p>



<p>Venyamin returned to The Soviet Union in 1953. He noticed anti Semitism had
grown more prevalent but was still able to find work as a department manager at
a secret military production facility in Minks. He had to destroy classified
documents before immigrating to Israel with his wife and children. They
eventually settled in Montreal.</p>
