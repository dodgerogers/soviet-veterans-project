<p>"They were supposed to defend the country repenting their crime with their
blood. <br>
My task was to confirm that they did"</p>

<p>Just before he turned 18, Moisei was placed in command of a platoon made up
entirely of convicted felons, released to “repent with their blood”:</p>

<p>“I was appointed to command a platoon of 60 men personnel. They were ex
cons who volunteered to fight at the front to make up for the crime they had
committed. When in prison some prisoners volunteered to defend the country.
Units were formed of ex cons. Between us, they were sent to the front as
condemned men.”</p>



<p>As a radio operator, Moisei would report to HQ on the men's behavior, in
addition to a regular infantryman's combat duty, and other communications
tasks. Their platoon was mostly used in reconnaissance situations during The
Defense of Moscow in 1941-42 and leading up to The Liberation of Riga in 1944.
They were placed between both firing lines at Moscow, moving at night to
determine the Nazi's position:</p>

<p>“Our combat task was to collect and pass on information about the enemy
moves and enemy planes missions. For this purpose … we dug… we did it in
the nighttime only, it was impossible to do it in the daytime. We were under
the enemy fire all the time, not mentioning the possibility of a friendly fire.
We were between two fires. We were able to work only at night”.</p>



<p>Moisei's unit focused on reconnaissance and was rarely used in attack
situation, though he did defend himself when necessary:</p>

<p>“Once I was in the pit. I heard a noise: a German was crawling to me. He
was wearing a helmet. I couldn't see his head. I was hesitating: to shoot or
not to shoot. Luckily for me, he turned his head and I shot him in the neck. He
turned his head, I shot him in the neck and killed him. I waited for a while to
be sure he was dead. I crawled up to him. I found out he was an officer. I
found on him: a Walther pistol, documents and 2 Solinger razor blades in a
small leather box”</p>



<p>Moisei enrolled in officer's training after the war. He graduated in the top
10 of his class and was sent to work at an institute in Turkmenistan. Moisei
eventually settled in Toronto.</p>
