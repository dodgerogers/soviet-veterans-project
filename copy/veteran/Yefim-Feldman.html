<p>Yefim enrolled in military college before the war began in 1940. His first
combat experiences came in The Baltic States in 1941. Yefim's unit moved into
 Russia proper and was surrounded near Smolensk:</p>

<p><i>“The hardest fighting I went through was in Dukhovshchina, Smolensk Region 
where huge numbers of German troops and technical equipment were concentrated.
We broke through the enemy defenses. 2 days later the Supreme Commander in
Chief issued an order giving our division the title of Dukhovshchina
Division.”</i></p>



<p>As a paramedic in a light infantry unit, Yefim would run throughout the 
front lines administering medical aid. He would also help move injured soldiers 
to hospital bound trains. Unlike the doctors who worked away from combat, Yefim 
treated his patents in the middle of the battlefield:</p>

<p><i>“We crawled up to the soldiers. If the injury was not too serious we gave
first aid, put on dressings, gave pain killers, and injections.”</i></p>



<p>Yefim was injured near Latvia and sent to Moscow hospital. He recovered in
time to rejoin his unit for <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/208">The Battle Of Riga</a> in October 1944.</p>



<p>After the war, Yefim moved to Toronto.</p>
