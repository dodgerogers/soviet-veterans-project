<p><b>Pre War:</b></p>

<p>Budyonny joined The Russian Army in 1903 and served as a non - commissioned
officer in World War One. He served in the cavalry in the Tsarist army. Bunyonny was awarded 4 St. George Crosses during  WWI, and received the highest distinction a soldier could achieve, the full  ribbon of a St. George Cavalryman.</p>

<p>Budyonny fought for the Bolsheviks during The Russian Civil War. He formed
what became known as The Red Cavalry Force and won key battles in Southern Russia. He also fought in the Polish-Soviet war of 1920, driving Polish forces
out of Ukraine before being defeated, along with other leading  Red Army figures like Tukachevsky, during the attack on Warsaw. Despite the
loss, Budyonny was considered a hero of the revolution and became a popular
figure in the new Soviet Union. He joined the Bolshevik Party in 1919 and
became close friends with <a href="index.html#/veterans/50">Joseph Stalin</a>.</p>

<p>Budyonny was a member of the court at Tukhachevsky's show trial in 1937. He argued that tank
techniques Tukhachevsky was promoting would never replace horses as cavalry
units. <a href="index.html#/veterans/46">Georgy Zhukov</a>
would later have tremendous success with ideas similar to Tukhachevsky's.</p>

<p><b>World War II:</b></p>

<p>At the start of the war, Budyonny commanded the Reserve Army and then Soviet forces in
Ukraine. He was severely defeated during the battles of Kiev and Uman. Budyonny presided over one of the largest  encirclements in military history. Though all he did was carry out Stalin's orders not to retreat under
any circumstances, Budyonny became a scapegoat for the Red Army's failures in
the early days of World War II. He was demoted to the post of Commander of the Red Army  Cavalry, which kept him busy behind the lines.</p>

<p><b>Post War:</b></p>

<p>The Red Army's inability to stop the German advance did little damage to
Budyonny's reputation in The Soviet Union. His popularity had been secured
thanks to being heavily featured in propaganda since the revolution, where he
was portrayed as a heroic general sympathetic to the everyday soldier. As one
of the few prominent figures from the revolutionary period never to fall out
with Stalin, Budyonny was still used in propaganda after the war. Budyonny was
seen more as a hero from The Bolshevik era as supposed to a failure from The
Second World War. Budyonny retired as a three time
<a href="index.html#/medals/100">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>. He
was also a world renowned horse breeder, creating the “Budyonny” horse
known for endurance. He died in 1973. He left his mark on the Red  Army—his military successes led to the pointed caps worn by soldiers being  renamed “Budyonny caps” in his honour.</p>
