<p>Vasilevsky was born in 1895. He studied in a seminary and planned on being
an agronomist but instead enrolled in the Alexeyev military school in Moscow at the start of
World War One. Vasilevsky was sent to the front in 1915 and was a well
respected Staff-Captain and company commander by 1916. He resigned from the army following the
revolution in 1917 and briefly worked as a teacher in Tula. Vasilevsky was
conscripted into The Red Army in 1919. During the Civil War he requisitioned grain from  peasants but was very active in The Polish-Soviet War. He joined The

The Moscow Peace Treaty in 1940. Vasilevsky was never implicated <a href="index.html#/stories/413">The Great Purge</a> of Soviet

<p><b>Post War:</b></p>

<p>Vasilevsky remained Chief of General Staff until February, 1945. He then became

holding high profile positions during subsequent regimes. He served in a number
of ceremonial roles before retiring from government service in 1957. Vasilevsky
briefly returned to prominence after publishing his memoirs in 1973. He died in
1977.</p>
