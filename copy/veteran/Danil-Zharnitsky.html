Germans. They would go hiding in shelters"</p>

<p>When the war started, Danil was transporting cattle from a Ukrainian
collective farm to Stalingrad. Unable to leave the city, Danil got a job as a
butcher and joined the partisans:</p>

<p>“I did the deboning, which means that I separated bones from meat. The
meat was used to do sausages. The bones were sold - hundreds of people were
lining up, I would leave the premises during the lunch break. I had small
pieces of meat stuck to my apron. People would rush trying to scrape them off
my apron with their knives. People were starving”.</p>

<p>After The Battle Of Stalingrad, he used his underground contacts to return
to Ukraine, where he remained active in the resistance. Danil was often sent in
disguise to discern the size and type of Nazi detachment:</p>

<p>“They tackled a horse with a cart. I was put on the cart. My task was to
get there to watch how many Germans arrived to let the partisans know their
numbers. I found out how many Germans were in the gendarmes group, carrying
submachine guns and machine guns, I went to the Kamenogorsky Plant where I met
the driver, I went to the detachment where I reported to the regiment command.
They thanked me officially, of course and considered of giving me an award.
Afterwards they attacked the German detachment. To make it short, we destroyed
the band taking their weapons from the dead bodies. That was the end of the
operation”</p>

<p>As a Senior Sergeant in SMERSH, Danil would spy on people suspected of
collaborating with the enemy:</p>

<p>“That job was… how to say…THE SPIES MUST DIE. If you are suspected, I
was told “Go there and find out that…” I went, found out and
reported.”</p>

<p>His last post was Colonel in a construction battalion, overseeing various
projects throughout Ukraine. Under Danil's leadership they were awarded the
title “ Communist Labour Company”</p>
