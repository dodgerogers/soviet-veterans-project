<p>Eugene joined the <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/410">partisans</a> in June 1942 after escaping a mass execution in
the ghetto. He had already lost both parents, two sisters, and one brother was 
killed at <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/210">The Battle Of Kursk</a> in December 1941. With the resistance, Eugene and 
his lone surviving brother did anything they could to disrupt the Nazi 
occupation:</p>

<p>“We used to blow up trains, put mines in the highways, kill motorcyclists,
putting a wire across the highway, we cut off their heads.”</p>



<p>During the winter of 1943 Eugene, his brother, and their partisan commander
were offered shelter by a family that was close with Eugene's before the war.
They were betrayed and only Eugene escaped, though he contracted stomach typhus
from running back to his unit through the snow:</p>

<p>“They told me my brother was killed, the other one and the commander. And
I told not to tell anybody, I want to go to the village to see the 2 brothers
who did the job. I came there, I find them there in the house, I pulled them
out of the house, I killed both of them.”</p>



<p>“In June '44 we was united with the Russian army. They give us new
uniforms. They put 10,000 and new from the hospital everything and they sent us
to the front line. That was the idea, Stalin's policy. They promise miracle,
you'll go, you save Russia, we'll look after you. They didn't have what to
give. And they sent 10,000 partisans to the front line.”</p>

<p>Eugene participated in The Capture Of Konigsberg with the heavy machine gun
division: “I went to heavy machine gun. On each corner of the division there
were machine guns on little wheels, 250 bullets in each section. 2 people - one
is carrying the bullets, one remain with the machine gun. And I was behind the
machine gun”.</p>



<p>After the war, Eugene immigrated to Canada and ran a furniture business in
Toronto.</p>
