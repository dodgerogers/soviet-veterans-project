<p><b>Pre War:</b></p>

<p>Ivan Konev was conscripted into the Russian army in 1916 but demobilized one
year later during the revolution. He joined The Red Army and The Bolshevik
Party in 1918, serving as Military Commissar of the Nikolsk District,  and later as part of the 17th Maritime Corps during The Russian Civil War. Konev
completed advanced officer training in 1926 and was made a corps commander in
1937.</p>

<p><b>WWII:</b></p>

<p>Konev was in Vitebsk when The Nazis invaded. He organized a tactical retreat
through Smolensk to Moscow. Konev was promoted to Colonel-General after
playing a key role in <a href="index.html#/battles/201">The Defense
of Moscow</a>. He lead the southern forces during <a href="index.html#/battles/210">The Battle of Kursk</a> in 1943, before being sent to
Ukraine. Konev was made Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1944 after his army
retook Belgorod, Odessa, Kharkiv, and Kiev. He and <a href="index.html#/veterans/46">Georgy Zhukov</a> coordinated a massive offensive in the
winter of 1945 that pushed The Germans out of Poland, allowed The Red Army to
<a href="index.html#/battles/204">Capture Konigsberg</a>, and assisted in  <a href="index.html#/battles/202">The Battle of
Berlin</a>. While Zhukov was given the honor of taking <a href="index.html#/battles/202">Berlin</a>, Konev was sent to Czechoslovakia, where his

<p><b>Post War:</b></p>

<p>After the war, Konev was made Commander-in-Chief  of the Central Group Forces, in charge of administering post-war Austria. Like most prominent war heroes, <a href="index.html#/veterans/50">Stalin</a> moved him to a less visible position,
Commander of the Carpathian Military District in 1951. After Stalin's death
Konev oversaw the trial of former <a href="index.html#/stories/412">NKVD</a> Chief Lavrentii Beria. Khruschev promoted him to First Deputy Minister  of Defense in 1956. In the same year, as Commander in Chief of Warsaw Pact  Forces, he suppressed The Hungarian Revolution. Konev retired in 1960 but was quickly recalled in 1961 and made
Commander of Soviet Forces in East Germany. He later served in the ceremonial
role of Inspector General of the Defense Ministry. Ivan Konev died in 1971 as
one of the most popular military figures in Soviet history. He is a two time <a href="index.html#/medals/100">Hero of the Soviet Union</a> and is
buried in The Kremlin Wall Necropolis.</p>
