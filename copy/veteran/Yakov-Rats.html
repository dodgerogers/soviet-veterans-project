<p>Yakov spent most of the war in a training squad attached to a tank division.
He would also assist with repairs and evacuations, cleaning up in the aftermath
of a battle and salvaging what parts he could. On one occasion Yakov was
involved in direct combat:</p>

<p>“I was a repairs squad commander. I didn't go to the attack, except on one
occasion while we were evacuating tanks, a heavy fire started. We saw a group
of Germans approaching us. We took our submachine guns and started shooting
back”.</p>



<p>Yakov stayed in the army until 1961. Despite recommendations from his
commanders, Yakov was rejected from several jobs: “The department manager
tried to prove that I was the best candidate for the position. The HR manager
said 'I know who we want'. I realized what kind of environment it was. Our
country went through anti-Semitic campaigns of “Cosmopolites” and “Doctor
Killers” and many more. There was nothing unexpected in store for us. When I
was denied the job I was hurt because I was good for the job”.</p>



<p>Yakov's family lived through The Siege Of Leningrad:</p>

<p>“My father passed away from starvation and cold during the siege of
Leningrad. The year '42 was the most horrible year: the bread ration was as
little as 125 gram a day, nothing more to eat. My mother served as a doctor at
a hospital, and my sister worked as a civilian projectionist at the same
hospital. At the beginning of '43 the hospital was evacuated from Leningrad to
the front via the Ice Road of Life, you may know what it was. As of that moment
my mother and I lost communication”.</p>

<p>Yakov only regained contact with his family through a random coincidence.
Working in an army hospital, Yakov's mother would ask every tank soldier if
they knew her son and eventually found one:</p>

<p>“She shows my photo. 'That's Yashka!' We were in different companies but
we stayed in a huge barrack. Our beds were close to each other. 'Where is he
now?' 'I am going to a new place, give me a letter for him, just in case'. She
writes a letter”. Yakov received his mother's letter before the war was
over.</p>
