<p>Alexi was born in Vinnitsa, Ukraine in 1921. He was drafted into The Red
Army in 1940 and assigned to a communications battalion:</p>

<p>“I was given different assignments. My job was to provide safe
communications in complicated conditions of retreat when the Germans captured
our communications devices.”</p>

<p>Alexi also participated in combat missions, including the first Soviet
engagement with the Nazis at Kishinev in June 1941. He was disciplined for
attacking a German detachment, while installing temporary communication lines,
rather than taking them prisoner:</p>

<p>“Who is going to bother taking them as POWs?” I threw a grenade into the
dugout. I heard them screaming inside the dugout. After that we left. But
someone obviously complained to the special department. They complained that I
threw a grenade instead of capturing POWs. I had no idea how many damn Fritzes
were inside there. I didn't have any pity for them. They had just blew up our
guys. That's what was happening day in day out. We didn't have pity for
them”.</p>

<p>As a Jew and a Komosol member it was unlikely Alexi would defect to the
Nazis, so he was tasked with intercepting German transmissions and stationed at
a remote listening post, close to the Nazi's front line:</p>

<p>“When the Germans spoke between themselves I could catch about 50% of what
they said. Who is your commander?” This kind of conversation was of some
interest for the army intelligence.”</p>

<p>Alexi was wounded throwing back a grenade when the Nazis discovered his
listening post. After recuperating, he was sent to the unit that liberated
Kaluga:</p>

<p>“It was an all-round offensive. We were in the second echelon. When we
entered Kaluga, I found 250 people Jews… Kaluga had been occupied by the
Germans for only 1 or 2 months We entered the church and saw the Jews there.
They were lucky we liberated them. The Germans didn't have time to kill
them”.</p>

<p>Alexi's name was Russianized on official documents while he was in the
military hospital. He changed it back after immigrating to Canada. </p>
