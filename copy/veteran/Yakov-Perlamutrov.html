<p>As an infantry fighter on the Ukrainian Front, Yakov 's job was simple:</p>

<p><i>“I was either walking or shooting. My job was killing the Germans,
shooting them from my machine-gun”</i></p>

<p>His unit defended Kharkov with the help of The 3rd Tank Army:</p>

<p><i>“I knocked out 3 vehicles with infantry men on board. I'm not sure if I 
killed anyone, but I know that in any case the vehicles were burnt down.
Besides, I knocked out a small tank, the Germans counter attacked with the help
of small tanks. I was aiming at their gun-ports and managed to put the small
tank on fire. The Germans jumped out and I killed them with my machine gun.
Also there was a German mortar battery bothering us all the time. I found a
good position and fired. They didn't bother us anymore.”</i></p>



<p>Yakov's division was ordered to follow retreating Nazis after <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/201">The Battle Of 
Kursk</a>: <i>“It was after the Battle of Kursk. We used to pursue the enemy after
battles. The Germans retreated on their vehicles while we had to pursue them on
feet. Our tanks destroyed the remains of the enemy divisions.”</i></p>



<p>Yakov was seriously wounded towards the end of the war and did not return to 
combat.</p>
