<p>Alexei was involved in tank combat throughout the war. He was a platoon
commander in charge of 3 tanks, with varying levels of personnel. Alexei's first
major action was in 1942 at <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/203">The Battle Of Stalingrad</a>:</p>

<p>“Stalingrad was completely in ruins. Our brigade was stationed near the
Tractor-building Plant, the Stalingrad Tractor-Building Plant. We were dug in
the ground, in the defensive. We were bombed. We shot back. We didn't let them
advance to Volga in our section of the battle field.”</p>

<p>He was wounded and sent to a hospital near Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>Alexei recovered and rejoined his unit. They fought in Danzig and advanced to <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/204">
Konigsberg</a>, where heavy fortifications made tanks vital to capturing the
city:</p>

<p>“We fought our way to Konigsberg where there were ancient forts… where
our… the former our soldiers defended along with the Germans. They were
Vlasov's army soldiers. They were POWs and they defended the Konigsberg forts.
The forts were the largest fortification on the avenue of approach to 
Konigsberg. The battle of Konigsberg was important because it was a German
stronghold, you see? There was a heavy concentration of troops. The city was
crammed with troops”</p>

<p>Alexei's family was confused as to whether or not he survived the war:</p>

<p>“When I was in the hospital the last time, my girlfriend sent a letter
saying that I was killed on the front and my mother ran to hang herself in the
attic. 2 weeks later they got a letter from me and my father convinced her that
I was alive and all that. I came back in '46 after the parade.”</p>

<p>After the war Alexei toured schools to share his experience with younger
generations. He and his 2 brothers immigrated to Canada.</p>
