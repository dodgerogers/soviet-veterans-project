"We were sleeping with our cloths on: the boots, the trench coats, and
the rifles, so that wewouldn't forget to take the rifle if alerted when
half-awake."

<p>In 1941, just before the Defense of Moscow, Mark was part of a motorcycle
battalion that helped transport officers throughout the city and was specially
trained in urban combat. “The chief of the staff of our battalion took me on
as his driver. I was driving him on the motorcycle. At that time the Germans
got very close to Moscow. We were trained for city street fighting as the
Germans were expected to capture Moscow”.</p>

<p>“We were being sent on missions all the time. We had to drive in any
weather: open motorcycles and a poor clothing, frostbitten hands and
feet…During one of the missions I got under bombing. There were bombings
every night. The bomb fell so close I was thrown away and lost my
consciousness”. Mark was evacuated from the city and recuperated in a
hospital in the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>When he recovered, Mark was sent to Manchuria and was involved in transport
tasks on the western front. “When the war with Japan started I was in
Manchuria: Chanchun, Mugden, and Kharbin. All the documents belonging to the
Kwantung Army's HQ were captured. I was appointed to escort those documents to
the HQ of Transbaikalia”. On some occasions, Mark was asked to translate when
German prisoners were interrogated.</p>

<p>After the war, Mark moved to Toronto to escape anti semetic persecution
under Stalin:</p>

<p>“During the Stalin era my brother was in prison for 10 year for no reason.
My father was in prison for 5 years during the Stalin era, also for no reason.
The oppression existed during the peace time rather than during the war”</p>
