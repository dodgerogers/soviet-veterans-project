<p>Leonid was drafted as soon as he was eligible, in 1937. He was initially
stationed in Lithuania, near Kaunas. For over a year they fought in trenches
against automatic weapons, without any of their own,. The unit was given
machine guns for the first time in 1942. Leonid was relocated to the western
front in 1944 to help break the siege of Leningrad: “The fighting was so
intense, that during some of the quiet moments neither we nor the Germans had
any energy to go on fighting. That didn't happen often”.</p>

<p>He explains how The Red Army had to climb mountains of ice, engineered by
the Nazis to secure their position:</p>

<p>“Before the lifting of the siege of Leningrad took place, the Germans set
up ice mountains in the places where the passage of the Soviet troops was
expected. The mountains were impassable. Our rock climbers equipped with
special calked boots worked their way through those mountains to throw down
woven threads for our troops to get over the mountains. Next, the Germans
realized that they went kaput and started surrendering”.</p>



<p>Leonid helped lift The Siege Of Leningrad, Liberate Riga, and Capture
Konigsberg. His communications platoon was responsible for gathering and
verifying intelligence, usually through prisoner capture missions:</p>

<p>“I was a group leader. The task was getting a prisoner who talks by all
means sparing no effort. And we did it.”</p>



<p>Leonid's unit contributed to The Liberation of Riga in 1944 and The Capture
Of Konigsberg in 1945. He considers the fighting near Tikhvin, in the winter of
1941 his most difficult combat experience:</p>

<p>“I can't think of any battle harder than the one we stood near Tikhvin.</p>

<p>The town was in ruins with loads of dead bodies thrown around - both Soviet
and German bodies. The Germans were taught a good lesson there. They were
better prepared than we though. My most important medal is Medal for Combat
Merits. That was the reason I survived. I received the medal after the Tikhvin
battle when my comrade pushed me into a shell hole and covered me with his
body”.</p>



<p>Throughout his service Leonid was awarded 5 different combat medals. He
moved to Canada in 1993.</p>
