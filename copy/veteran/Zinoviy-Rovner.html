<p>Zinvoly was drafted in 1943 and sent to eastern Russia immediately after
training. When the Soviets declared war on Japan in 1945, he was sent to
Korea:</p>

<p>“ As the battery gun were on horse traction we weren't allowed to sit on
gun's boxes, only the “coach” was allowed to be in the coachman's seat. We
quick marched 40 to 60 kilometers a day We were on the go all the time
dislodging the enemy from the hills and weapon emplacements. That's what the
war was like. We liberated the North Korean territory from the Japanese
occupants.”</p>

<p>Zinvoly carried a gun but did not fire mortars:</p>

<p>“I was to provide communication between the battery command and the weapon
emplacements. The battery was in one location; the battery commander was
defining the target at an observation post in another location. The battery was
firing while we were adjusting the fire, doing the spotting for mortars.
Personally… that was just a normal, a regular military service, making sure
the enemy would be defeated”.</p>

<p>After the war, Zinoviy spent 5 more years in the army. He encountered
numerous cases of institutional Anti Semitism in Ukraine while trying to finish
school and eventually immigrated to Canada.</p>
