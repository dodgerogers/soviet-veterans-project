<p>Zinvoly was drafted in 1943 and sent to eastern Russia immediately after 
training. When the <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/209">Soviets declared war on Japan in 1945</a>, he was sent to 
Korea:</p>

<p><i>“As the battery gun were on horse traction we weren't allowed to sit on
gun's boxes, only the “coach” was allowed to be in the coachman's seat. We
 quickly marched 40 to 60 kilometers a day We were on the go all the time 
dislodging the enemy from the hills and weapon emplacements. That's what the
 war was like. We liberated the North Korean territory from the Japanese 
occupants.”</i></p>

<p>Zinvoly carried a gun but did not fire mortars:</p>

<p><i>“I was to provide communication between the battery command and the weapon
 placements. The battery was in one location; the battery commander was 
defining the target at an observation post in another location. The battery was
 firing while we were adjusting the fire, doing the spotting for mortars.
Personally… that was just a normal, a regular military service, making sure 
the enemy would be defeated”.</i></p>

<p>After the war, Zinoviy spent 5 more years in the army. He encountered
 numerous cases of institutional antisemitism in Ukraine while trying to finish 
school and eventually immigrated to Canada.</p>
