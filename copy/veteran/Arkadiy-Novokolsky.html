<p>Arkadiy was born at the end of a forced famine. Ukrainian Nationalists
murdered his father before he turned 2. Never having received a proper birth 
certificate, Arkadiy could not attend public school. Arkadiy's mother worked
 extra hours as a seamstress to pay for his Jewish education. Despite his
difficult upbringing Arkadiy considered himself a patriot and enrolled in 
military college in 1938. He was an air force engineer by 1940.</p>

<p>Arkadiy's first assignments were inspections of various aerodromes 
throughout the western front. He was on one of these survey missions, near 
Belarus, when the Nazis invaded in 1941. During The Red Army's initial retreat,
Arkadiy's unit passed through Minsk while regrouping to <a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/201">the Moscow area</a>:</p>

<p><i>“When we reached Minsk, we saw a terrible picture. The entire downtown 
Minsk…all the buildings were bare, without roofs - Germans had bombed down 
Minsk. We didn't stay long in Minsk, because Germans were advancing
unrestrainedly and without resistance as the troops had been taken 
unawares”.</i></p>

<p>Arkadiy's regiment was stationed just outside Moscow in late 1941 and stayed
until the battle was over in early 1942. They flew reconnaissance missions
every night, monitoring the movements of Nazi forces. Arkadiy realized
nighttime cameras needed to be improved:</p>

<p><i>“We created a new camera. The idea was that at night the objective lens
needed to be open. When a bomb is released, it explodes, and during 1/50 sec.
the shutter should close. We were sitting nights working on creating such a
camera. We succeeded. And I went on a testing in field conditions. The bombers
were coming in to our regiment. We reequipped them into reconnaissance planes.
We were implementing new equipment. Later a swinging device was designed and
made with my participation. It was a vertical device, swinging left and right.
That way we saved…well 1 plane was performing the scope of 3 planes when
taking pictures of a large area.”</i></p>

<p>Arkadiy was one of the few engineers that insisted on personally field
testing their designs: <i>“After we made a new nigh-vision photo camera, I
 insisted that I was permitted to go on missions. I had no fear at all. Even
when I suggested myself to go on a mission with the new device, I had no fear
 whatsoever. By the way this is what happened on one of the missions. All of a
sudden, the radio operator/gunner shouts…the third man on the
crew…'Commander! A fighter on the right!' I looked to the right and saw a
headlight turned in our direction…turned in our direction I was so calm. The 
pilot made a wise decision. He dived into the clouds. We became invisible.
Later, when we were approaching Vitebsk airdrome, he dived out of clouds. When
we were getting closer, flying under clouds and over the airdrome, that's when
I felt…those sounds of powerful anti-aircraft artillery, those
searchlights”.</i></p>

<p>Arkadiy immigrated to Toronto after the war. He is part of a veterans 
committee that visits schools to talk about Jewish life in The Soviet Union and 
World War Two.</p>
