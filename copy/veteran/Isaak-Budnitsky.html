<p>Issak had spent a year in The Red Army before the war. He was in Stanislav
when The Germans invaded:</p>

<p>“I was left behind for 10 to 15 days. We liquidated everything related to
ammunition. We could hardly leave the place because there was only one way out
of Stanislav - via Lvov. The hardships during the retreat were worse than in
any war. Those were hardships regarding food, overnight stays, wandering
strange places that nobody could imagine to be in. We lived there… we
retreated gradually… Personally, as a sergeant major, I managed to get out of
encirclement in Aksai area via the Aksai bridge. I carried a lot of our unit's
documents with me. My subordinate guys and I took the documents to Russia”</p>

<p>After the initial retreat, Issak and his unit were sent to The Battle Of
Stalingrad:</p>

<p>“We serviced aviation. You know that aviation demands a great volume of
bombs etc. You also know that all those weren't kept at the front line. They
were kept in the rear of the army. We had to supply truck loads, several truck
loads, during the night time… only in the night…24 hours…I used to sleep
2 hours a night. We didn't have other time…We used to supply ammunition all
the time to make sure the bomb aviation functioned non-stop. That's why we were
in action literally 24 hours a day bringing the ammunition to the front line
aviation. We went through a lot of hardships in Stalingrad in regards to our
troops. I was awarded a number of medals for my combat merits”</p>

<p>Issak's unit then fought through Crimea on their way to liberating Vienna.
They were in Austria when the war ended. Issak stated in the army for 3 more
years. He became a prominent leader in his local communist party but was
ostracized when his daughter decided to move to Israel. Isaak and his wife
eventually moved to Canada.</p>
