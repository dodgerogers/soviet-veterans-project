<p>Noah Shneidman joined the <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/410">partisans</a> at 15, after the Nazis invaded Poland in
1939:</p>

<p>“There were partisans who were like military units. There was a Jewish
partisan detachment in the area where I went to the forest. I was 150 miles
from my city and this detachment was attached to a big partisan brigade. And
there were many Jews there. But there were also not detachments but camps,
Jewish camps of people who were not partisans, but they were simply escapees,
refugees. I was in the Jewish detachment for several months”</p>

<p>Noah was separated from his detachment after they abandoned their position
while he and two others were gathering food:</p>

<p>“Nobody there, it's empty, completely. We don't know what to do. We walk
around, we walk around…and then we learnt that not far from our detachment
there was a special detachment. The commander came over. He looked at us. He
sees 3 young guys, he's a Russian fellow you know, well dressed, well armed. He
looked, he was thinking and then he says 'You want to go with us? If we'll go
through, you'll go through, if we don't go through, we'll perish together' We
go with them”.</p>

<p>Noah eventually enlisted in The Red Army, where he took advantage of an
ability to speak German:</p>

<p>“I was attached to the infantry regimental reconnaissance unit. That was a
unit, which was assigned a task crossing the front line and bringing a German
across the line. We were going every night we bring in the engineering 
reconnaissance. And they go first, they clear the passage from mines and they
stay and wait by the way we pass through the passage which they cleared for us
and then we go there, we try to shock a German, hit him whatever there were 
different ways and to drag him alive across no one's land and bring him back to
our side. But in our unit I was the smallest one. I was taken to the unit 
because I knew German. That was my contribution”.</p>

<p>Noah was evntually recommended for officer's training, but his German 
language skills and partisan background raised suspicion:</p>

<p>“I was invited for an interview. What I learnt later that was a SMERSH
officer. He interrogated me and he asked me where I was until I get to the
front line. Since I was under Nazi occupation I was a potential spy or
whatever. And not myself and not the other one who was also a former
partisan.</p>

<p>So in other words we weren't of the appropriate caliber to become Soviet
officers”.</p>

<p>Noah was eventually transferred to The Budhenny Cavalry Corps, where he
participated in <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/204">The Battle of Konigsberg</a> in 1945 and was the first Soviet unit
to enter German soil. While in Poland, preparing to march towards <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/202">Berlin</a>, his 
affinity for languages raised suspicions for a second time:</p>

<p>“They called me to the counterintelligence department. And I had an
interview with the deputy head of the corps. “He asked me 'how do you know
some of the language, you couldn't go to University, too young for that'. I
said 'I grew up to understand with all those languages. He made a note and I
felt that for several weeks I was watched. They observed me what I'm doing. And
after that he called me in his department again and he said 'you'll work for
me'. I was riding with the head of the department and whatever they were doing.
I was already with machine gun and I was like a security man but at the same
time I was an interpreter because I knew German, I knew Polish and I knew
Lithuanian. Mainly I was interrogating prisoners and Germans and others and
Soviet war prisoners and I would read the maps because the Soviets didn't have
their own maps yet for those areas”</p>

<p>Noah immigrated to Canada and became of professor of Russian literature in
Toronto.</p>
