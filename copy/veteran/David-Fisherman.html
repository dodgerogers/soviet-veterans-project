<p>David began his compulsory army service in 1937. He was demobilized in 1940
after serving as tank mechanic and driver. In 1940 he was called to the
military commissariat and asked to reenlist. David was near Odessa when the
Germans invaded:</p>

<p>“At that time I was a sergeant. There was an alarm in the night and the
war began. We marched as long as Nizhniy Tagil we reached Voznesensk. We headed
to the railways. The railway didn't work because of German air raids. In March
or April our company was manned, we were given the T-34 tanks. It was me who
drove them to the location we were stationed. In April we arrived in Tbilisi,
the location where the new middle tank brigade was formed. The unit number was
#52”.</p>

<p>David's first serious combat was in Caucuses:</p>

<p>“North Caucasus was very attractive for the Germans because of the fuel.
They needed fuel as much as we did. They tried various plans to get to Groznyy
where a major oil refining plant was situated. Unfortunately for them and
fortunately for us they never got to it. As far as we knew, 14 intact tanks
remained in the field, on our side, the rest were destroyed and there were dead
bodies lying around. Our brigade was awarded the title of Guards for heroism
during the defence of Caucasus.”</p>



<p>The brigade received more accolades for successfully defending Vitebsk.
After Belarus, they fought at the liberations of Lithuania and Latvia. There
were only small pockets of Nazi resistance by the time David arrived in <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/208">
Riga</a>:</p>

<p>“We liberated Riga from a handful of obstinately resisting Germans.
However we broke them to go on advancing. Our tank brigade stayed near Riga. At
that time, the war was nearly over.”</p>



<p>After the war David went to vocational school and worked as a mechanic in
Odessa. He was drafted for a third time in 1949, this time serving as an
vocational training foreman before immigrating to Canada.</p>
