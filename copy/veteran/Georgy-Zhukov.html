<p><b>Pre War:</b></p>

<p>Born in 1896, Zhukov was conscripted into the Tsarist army in 1915, joined the Red Army in 1918 and was given his first significant command at <a>Khalkhin Gol</a> in 1939. The decisive victory was due to his pioneering use of tanks and flanking maneuvers. Some of these techniques were based on disgraced Marshall Tukhachevsky's theory of ”deep operations”. Zhukov was made Chief of General Staff of the Red Army in 1941 and warned against a German invasion, though Soviet leadership dismissed his ideas.</p>

<p><b>World War II:</b></p>

<p>After arguing with <a>Stalin</a> over war preparations, the initial retreat, and counter offensive plans, Zhukov was demoted to Commander of the Reserve Front in 1941. Stalin kept him as a member of The Soviet High Command and ordered Zhukov to <a>'save Leningrad'</a>. The siege was already in progress when he was given this assignment. Zhukov coordinated attacks to weaken German and <a>Finnish</a> lines, creating small openings for supplies to enter the city. It also allowed for evacuations along the frozen Lake Lagoda in 1943.</p>

<p>Once it was clear Leningrad would be under siege for some time, Zhukov was ordered to focus his attention on <a>Moscow</a>. The successful defense of the capital put him back in Stalin's good graces. Zhukov was promoted to Deputy Supreme Commander of the Soviet Armed Forces in August 1942 and oversaw <a>The Battle of Stalingrad</a>. Zhukov then supervised the successful operation to partially lift the blockade of Leningrad in January 1943. For this, he was promoted to Marshall of the Soviet Union. Zhukov then took a leading role in the <a>Battle of Kursk</a>, repelling the final German offensive on the eastern front. He was briefly called back to Moscow before being placed in command of the 1st Belorussian Front, which he lead from the liberation of Belarus to The <a>Battle of Berlin.<a></p>

<p><b>Post War:</b></p>

<p>After the war, Zhukov was made Supreme Military Commander of the Soviet
Occupied Zone in Germany. In 1946 he was elected to the Supreme Soviet and  appointed commander-in-chief of Soviet ground forces. He was soon demoted and reposted to Odessa, then made Commander of the Ural Military Zone
as part of <a href="joseph_stalin.html">Stalin's</a>
strategy to minimize the roles of popular wartime figures, in fear they would
become his rivals. Beginning in 1950, Zhukov returned to prominence. He
formed an alliance with Nikita Khrushchev and arrested his former rival, <a href="NKVD.html">MVD (and former NKVD)</a> Chief Lavrentii Beria. Zhukov
was Minister of Defense from 1955-57. He eventually fell out with Khrushchev
and was forced into retirement. Zhukov died  in 1974 after being
publically redeemed by the Brezhnev regime.</p>

<p>Georgy Zhukov is considered the hero of World  War II in the Soviet Union.
He was criticized for his authoritarian approach to command but praised for his
ingenuity in tank combat and general strategy. Zhukov was the only purely military figure to  receive the title <a href="medals.html" style="color:#0000ff">Hero of the Soviet Union</a> four times, placing him on par with Brezhnev.</p>
