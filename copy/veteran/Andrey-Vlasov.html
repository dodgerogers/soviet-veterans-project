<p><b>Pre War:</b></p>

<p>Born in 1900, Vlasov dropped out of divinity school after The Russian
Revolution. He joined The Red Army in 1919 and The Communist party in 1930.
Vlasov distinguished himself during the Russian Civil War and was sent to China 
as an advisor to Chiang Kai Shek from 1938-39. Vlasov was given command of a
rifle division in 1940. He was frequently praised by Soviet leadership and
considered a 'rising star' in The Red Army. </p>

<p><b>WWII:</b></p>

<p>Vlasov was commanding a mechanized tank group near Kiev when the Nazis 
invaded in 1941. His unit was one of the few to escape encirclement in Ukraine.
In January 1942 Vlasov was featured in wartime propaganda beside <a href="index.html#/veterans/46">Georgy Zhukov</a> for his role
in <a href="index.html#/battles/201">The Defense of Moscow</a>.</p>

<p>In July 1942 Vlasov was attempting to break <a href="index.html#/battles/200">The Siege of Leningrad</a>
when his forces were surrounded in German held territory. He was taken prisoner
and began professing an Anti-Stalinist point of view. The Nazis saw the 
charismatic general, who was popular with his men as a
valuable propaganda tool. Vlasov was taken back to Germany where he wrote a 
pamphlet criticizing Soviet policies that was airdropped into The Soviet
Union. He would lecture to captured Soviet POWs, hoping to recruit them into his Russian
Liberation Army that would fight on the German side to free Russia from Stalin's rule.</p>

<p>The Nazis were initially reluctant to allow Vlasov to command an army in battle—rather than creating one for propaganda purposes—but they relented and Vlasov led troops in minor  fighting along the Oder River, before moving south in mid-April 1945. The force was stationed near <a href="index.html#/battles/206">Prague</a>. Vlasov then switched sides again and
fought in a few battles on behalf of the Czech resistance. Not wanting to face
The Soviets or The Nazis, Vlasov retreated west and surrendered to The
Americans. He was forcibly repatriated to The Soviet Union and executed for
treason in 1946.</p>

<p>Andrey Vlasov is remembered as a traitor.  His Russian Liberation movement inspired other Soviet soldiers to defect and "Vlasov's forces" came to represent Anti-Stalinist or Anti-Communist soldiers from  the USSR fighting against the Red Army during the war. Within the USSR, the name Vlasov and anyone serving in his Liberation Army ("Vlasovites") became synonymous with the  highest form of treachery both during and after the war.</p>
