<p>Zinoviy was 12 when Germany invaded The Soviet Union. He was sent to the train 
station to buy vegetables when Nazi planes first attacked Leningrad:</p>

<p><i>“The Messerschmitts escorting the dive bombers started shooting short
bursts of fire at the people gathered in the square. Well, the dead were 
silent. But wounded people started screaming. A panic started. Scared to death
I started running to the nearby dune where I hid in a very old trench. A suburb
train arrived at the station. The train stopped, the engineer didn't know what
was going on. It stopped, the people poured onto the platform and into the
 square. That was where a big bloodshed took place. The Messerschmitts increased 
their shooting.”</i></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/200">The Siege of Leningrad</a> technically began on in September 1941. Zinoviy remembers the Nazis ensuring people would starve by attacking the city's food
 reserves in late August:</p>

<p><i>“On the 31st of August, they burnt down Badaevsky warehouses. Badaevsky 
warehouses were on fire for 3 days and nights. Messerschmitts shot the fire 
engines that had come to the warehouses. They didn't let the fire subside.
Badaevsky warehouses were on fire for 3 days and nights. Leningrad's 5-year
emergency storage was burnt down there.”</i></p>

<p>Zinoviy started the 5th grade while the city was under siege:</p>

<p><i>“We were given shovels and sent to dig trenches or rather not trenches but 
anti-tank ditches”.</i></p>

<p>His family survived by eating potatoes they grew in their garden and food 
that was originally intended for their cow.</p>

<p>Zinoviy escaped Leningrad over the“ice bridge” in 1943:</p>

<p><i>“Some of the trucks sank into ice holes. However we crossed the lake 
Ladozhskoye safely.”</i></p>

<p>Zinoviy and his family spent the rest of the war in Kazakhstan. He joined the
army in 1947 and eventually became an officer, serving at bases in Konigsberg 
and the far east. Zinoviy later immigrated to Canada.</p>
