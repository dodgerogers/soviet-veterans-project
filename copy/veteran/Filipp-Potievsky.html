<p>Filipp's unit was initially stationed in Lithuania. They were sent to
Belarus just after the Nazis invaded but arrived too late to stop them from
occupying Minsk in 1941:</p>

<p>“When passing through Minsk, the Germans had already occupied the city.
They were in the city. And we lost the colours the colonel was sitting on a
stump in the forest, nearly crying, pulling his hair out, saying: “They
should kill me for losing the colours and the division. In short, the surviving
personnel was transferred to a reserve tank regiment. We thought that the
division would be formed over. However the division was disbanded. The reason:
the colours had been lost.”</p>

<p>Filipp was injured fighting with the newly formed division during The
Defense Of Moscow:</p>

<p>“I was wounded. The guys carried me to the forest, the forest! There were
trenches there from the Napoleonic war, you know in fact it was near Moscow,
300-400 km away from Moscow or less. They left me firewood, cut some branches,
I had neither a greatcoat nor a waterproof cape, not even a field cap. They
left me tobacco and matches. There was absolutely nothing to eat. I stayed
lying there for 4 days and nights with no water, no bread, absolutely nothing
to eat. I didn't see any Germans there. A 10 year old boy pastured his cow and
a few sheep there”</p>

<p>The boy eventually told his father about the wounded soldier lying in the
forest. The father rescued Filipp, having him pose as a cousin doing an
apprenticeship on their farm while he recovered. This was necessary as the farm
was in German held territory and Nazis turned the farmhouse into a base. Filipp
did in fact repay the farmer's kindness with carpentry work. He stayed with the
family through the winter and kept his identity secret around the Germans. He
is probably the only Jewish soldier to celebrate Christmas with Nazis:</p>

<p>“On December 25 they had their Christmas holiday. Everyone in the house
was to sit around the table and make a gulp of vodka from the glass. Just one
gulp for everyone. I was among them: the man, his children, and everyone, and
the Germans. What if they knew who was among them.”</p>

<p>Another group of Red Army soldiers separated from their detachment came
across the farm shortly after that Christmas, in early 1943. Filipp helped them
hide from the Germans and when it was safe, accompanied them back to the front
lines. Commanding officers were suspicious that he had been away so long and
assigned him to a penal unit. Filipp was wounded by a sniper but recovered in
time to rejoin a regular riffle regiment. With that unit, he crossed though
Poland and reached The Elbe River in Germany when the war ended in 1945.</p>

<p>Filipp moved to Uzbekistan and started a family after the war. He later
moved to Montreal.</p>
