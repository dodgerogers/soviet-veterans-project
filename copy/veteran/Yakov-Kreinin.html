<p>At the beginning of the war Yakov was a student at Moscow Artillery College.
On graduation he was given the rank of Guards lieutenant, Katyusha platoon
commander</p>

<p>“On June 22nd, '41, all the students were gathered in front of the
building. We were told that Viacheslav Molotov, our Foreign Minister, would be
making a speech. In his speech he said “Today, at 2 a.m. the German Nazi
troops attacked, without declaring the war, our border squads and peaceful
cities. Many cities and garrisons were bombarded. The German troops crossed our
border”.</p>



<p>Soviet army wasn't prepared for war and along with all other Soviet troops
His unit retreated from 1941 to 1943. They stopped retreating in Ukraine and
went on an offensive, advancing through Ukraine and Poland, liberating cities
and Majdanek Concentration Camp.</p>

<p>“I saw them [concentration camp survivors]. They were behind the fence
looking very exhausted and famished. We exchanged words with them. But our task
was to move further. They were happy to have survived. They were in rags and
famished. However, their faces looked happy. It looked like a huge settlement
of barracks painted green. Do you want me to go on speaking? I saw rails near
the gates. “Arber macht frein” was written on the gates: 'Labour makes one
free'. Those words were targeted at those who were about to be
annihilated.”</p>



<p>His unit continued their march west, eventually reaching Berlin where he
ended the war. Yakov was part of the initial artillery assault during <ahref="http://www.sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/202">The 
Battle of Berlin</a>, in 1945:</p>

<p>“When we were in Berlin we saw it in ruins because it had been bombarded
by our artillery, Katyushas, aviation, and Allies' aviation. Berlin's streets
were in ruins. They got what they were planning to do to other nations. We were
happy to have survived, to have our comrades with us.”</p>
