of Stalingrad</a>. It focuses on a prolonged sniper duel and touches on the
battle's importance to Soviet moral. The Red Army's victory is considered the
turning point in the war on the eastern front. It marked the end of <a
href="index.html#/battles/212"><span >Germany's initial
advance into Russia</a> and set the stage for a Soviet offensive. While
being one of the bloodiest battles in recorded history, Stalingrad was the
first time in the war where the Red Army was able to make significant gains in
German held territory. <a href="index.html#/veterans/15"

<p>The real life Vasiley Zaitsev fought at Stalingrad. He had 257 confirmed sniper
kills and was featured in propaganda.</i></p>

<p>The movie angered many veterans of the actual battle. They took issue with
the implication that Red Army soldiers were undisciplined and forced to fight.
Many felt that the plot about 2 snipers ignores the close quartered combat that
actually characterized the battle. They were also unhappy that the movie only
touches on Stalingrad's harsh winter conditions.

<p>Khrushchev was at <a href="index.html#/battles/203">Stalingrad</a> but acted more as a political liaison than
military strategist. He was involved in selecting Zaitsev for a propaganda
campaign, focusing on examples of individual heroism. </p>
