<p>There is a reference to Stalin deliberately delaying breaking the siege to eliminate political enemies in Leningrad. Though this has been suggested in other media and by some historians the claim is very much open for debate</p>

<p>Survivors have verified some of the more gruesome depictions of hunger/survival such as: people dropping dead in the middle of the streets and the bodies remaining outside for days or weeks and eating glue from paper hangings or in extreme cases dead humans</p>
