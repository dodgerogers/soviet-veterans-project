<p>Inglorious Basterds  was a fantasy revenge film in which American Jewish soldiers manage to kill the Nazi top command.  While interesting and popular at the box office, the movie received mixed reviews from many veterans as it appeared to treat a painful subject matter with almost a cartoonish rewriting of' history'<p>

<p>Nevertheless this movie was one of the reasons  we chose to seek out the truth of what was really happening during the war- from the people who fought and suffered the most- veterans of the Soviet Red Army and most importantly Jewish Soviet veterans.</p>

<p>While the movie depicts American Jews taking revenge on the Nazis and Americans played a major role towards the end of the war. It was the Soviet  Jewish soldiers who as you will tell from the videos and their own stories- were the actual Glorious Basterds -who were part of the winning forces who conquered the enemy and were in part responsible for saving the world from the Nazis.</p>

<p>The tragic part of their true life stories was that very few of the Soviet Jewish soldiers were even aware of the holocaust which was systematically eliminating Jews around the world and then their return to a highly hostile, anti-Semitic environment in Post War Stalinist Soviet Union.</p>
