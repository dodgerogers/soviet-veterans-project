<p>2004 Directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel</p>

<p>The film was praised for its historical recreation of <a href="http://sovietjewishveterans.com/#/battles/202">The Battle Of Berlin</a> drawing on the books Inside Hitler's Bunker by historian Joachim Fest and Until the Final Hour the memoirs of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries and a character in the film</p>

<p>There was a considerable amount of controversy surrounding Downfall when it was released. The film was criticized for humanizing Hitler by making him the main character.</p>

<p>Much of the movie takes place inside Hitler’s bunker in Berlin. Historians generally praise the physical recreation of the bunker. Since the movie is dialogue heavy and drawn from survivors memoirs, there is no way to verify if many of the conversations actually took place.</p>

<p>Some of Hitler’s dialogue is taken from Albert Speer’s memoirs, meaning Hitler actually used the many of the phrases he utters in the film but not necessarily in the bunker.</p>

<p>Soviet Soldiers actually found a Gold Nazi Party Membership Badge like the one Hitler gives to Magda Goebbels in the bunker after the Battle Of Berlin</p>

<p>Magda Goebbels was not present for Hitler’s final speech</p>

<p>Many Nazis who committed suicide did in fact shoot themselves after taking a cyanide capsule. This was done because the cyanide capsule were made in the concentration camps and prisoners would often sabotage the pills by making them non-lethal. Hitler likely poisoned his dog to test the capsules he had in the bunker.</p>

<p>The map in the bunker shows Post War Soviet borders</p>

<p>Some historians argue that Downfall was too sympathetic towards Wilhelm Mohnke and Ernst-Günther Schenck. Schenck was a doctor at Dachau and Mauthaussen concentration camps and was not allowed to practice medicine after the war. Mohnke was rumored to have ordered the execution of British POWs near Dunkirk but the allegations have never been proven.</p>

<p>The chronology of Hitler receiving news of various German defeats is historically accurate</p>
