<p>● Prisoners
really were released and forced to serve in the army <a

<p>● The phrase
“repent with their blood” meant they were often given dangerous
assignments</p>

<p>● The mission
depicted in the film was never attempted by any army and likely would have been
assigned to trained commandoes instead of convicts. </p>

<p>● The prisoner
units, like the on Moisei Chernoguz was placed in command of, were sent behind
enemy lines on reconnaissance missions or prisoner capture missions but never
to do anything as intricate as in the film.</p>

<p>● The movie's
fictional story is based on E.M. Nathanson's 1965 novel of the same name.</p>

<p>● The movie is
loosely based on an American Unit nicknamed “The Filthy 13”, for their
undisciplined reputation though none of them were convicts. They were a
photographed with mowhawk haircuts and war paint, which enhanced their
rebellious reputation.</p>

<p>● The “Filthy
13” were pathfinders, meaning they parachuted ahead of the main forced and
cleared a path, usually through demolition. The expected casualty rate was
between 80-90%</p>

<p>● Similar
pathfinder units existed though none were populated with convicts and The Red
Army never distinguished them from other airborne units like in The American
Armed Forces. The reconnaissance work Moisei Chernoguz explains is similar, but
on a smaller scale, without parachuting or explosives.</p>
