<p>● The Bielski brothers really did lead a group of Jews in a forest
settlement. 1236 Jews lived in The Naliboki Forest under their leadership for
almost 2 years.</p>

<p>● They only move camp once in the film, in reality the settlement was
designed to be somewhat mobile and moved several times.</p>

<p>● There were actually 8 Beilski brothers, 5 more in addition to the 3 the
movie focuses on. Asael was actually older than Zeus and was initially Tuvia's
second in comman</p>

<p>● The Beilski's did conduct raids on villages and against Nazi
collaborators, at one point their was a 100 000 Reichsmark bounty on Tuvia
Beilski but like any partisan unit they avoided contact with Nazi forces
whenever possible. When they did fight, they mostly targeted Nazi collaborators
and would sometimes kill their entire families.</p>

<p>● Initially the Bielski Group cooperated with Soviet Forces in the area.
In 1944, when Belarus and Poland were liberated relations between the two
factions deteriorated. The Beilski group developed a reputation for their well
run camp and successful sabotage missions, NKVD officials interrogated them
about wealth they had allegedly accumulated during the war. The brothers and
many of their followers resisted joining The Red Army and fled west. That being
said, the relationship between The Beilski's and The Soviets was generally more
acrimonious than the one portrayed on screen.</p>

<p>● Many veterans spoke about being integrated into the Red Army as their
areas were liberated. Asael Beilski was conscripted and killed at The Battle of
Konigsberg.</p>

<p>● Tuvia and Zeus never separated during the war and most witness agree the
Beilski brothers were imposing and strong willed, the younger brothers deferred
to Tuvia's leadership.</p>

<p>● They never successfully fought of a group of panzer tanks</p>

<p>● The pneumonia medicine that Zeus goes to steal would not have been
available in Belarus until the 1960s</p>

<p>● The real Tuvia Beilski could speak German and therefore would not have
needed a Nazi's papers translated</p>

<p>● There is disagreement about the role of women in the camp. Many accounts
dispute the portrayal of “forest wives” in the film. 70% of the Beilski
partisans were women so the pairing off depicted in the film would have been
impossible.</p>

<p>● Tuvia actually knew Lilka before they went into the forest. She was his
second wife's niece and nearly half his age. They were married after the
war.</p>
