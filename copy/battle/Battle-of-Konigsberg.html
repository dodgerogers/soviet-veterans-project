<p>The former East Prussian capital of Konigsberg had been a military stronghold for
centuries. The city was a heavily fortified and held strategic and symbolic
importance for both sides. Soviet forces arrived in the area in late January
1945. The RAF had destroyed most of the perimeter defenses in a bombing
campaign in 1944, allowing the Red Army to surround Konigsberg and prepare an
assault with little opposition.</p>

<p>The attack began on April 6th 1945. Heavy shelling allowed Soviet ground
troops to overwhelm the German forces.  The fighting lasted
for two more days until April 9th, when The Red Army had taken control of most
of the city and were constantly shelling what remained of The Nazi forces. On the morning of April 10, the Germans did surrender. Large portions of the city were destroyed in the  air raids and later in battle, while the remainder of the cityâ€™s core was razed  after the war. Capturing Konigsberg along with the rest of East Prussia provided The Red Army with a staging ground
for the <a href="index.html#/battles/202">Berlin Offensive</a>.</p>
