<p>The battle for Prague lasted from May 6-11th 1945. German forces in
Czechoslovakia continued fighting 3 days after the official surrender. The
Prague Uprising began on May 5th when The Czech Resistance, prompted by
American forces entering Plzen and the Nazi's inevitable defeat in <a
href="index.html#/battles/202">Berlin</a>, launched an attack on the
occupying Germans. </p>

<p>The Soviet Union and The Western Allies both wanted control of
Czechoslovakia after the war and it seemed whoever controlled Prague would hold
the country. <a href="index.html#/veterans/50">Stalin</a>
recalled <a href="veterans/48">Marshall Ivan
Konev's</a> 1st Ukrainian front from <a href="index.html#/battles/202">Berlin</a> to lead The Soviet attack on Prague, hoping to
ensure the Czechoslovakia would be part of the Eastern Block after the war.
Though The Red Army never formally worked with the resistance, German forces in
Czechoslovakia were stretched thin dealing with the uprising and concurrent
Soviet invasion. The Germans signed a surrender agreement on May 7th that went
into effect on the 9th. German forces in Czechoslovakia continued to resist until the 11th though
the city had been under Soviet control for several days. </p>
