<p>Soviet and Romanian forces placed the
city under siege on December 24th 1944 while marching towards <a
href="index.html#/battles/202">Berlin</a>. This was one of the war’s deadliest sieges, with 70,000 dead, over 202,000 wounded and 8,000  prisoners captured, for a total of 280,000 Red Army and Romanian casualties. More than 48,000 Germans and Hungarians were killed, 26,000  wounded and 63,000 captured for a total of 137,000 casualties. Approximately 38,000 civilians also 
lost their lives. German and Hungarian forces made three unsuccessful attempts to
 break the siege in January 1945. </p>

<p>The situation got worse for civilians when the Danube River froze at the end
of January, closing their only supply channel. A final breakout attempt was 
made on February 11th 1945, which initially surprised The Red Army but was also
 unsuccessful and left many civilians caught in the crossfire. The Germans 
surrendered 2 days later on February 13th, after most of Budapest had been 
destroyed. Capturing the city gave The Red Army control of a strategic road way
 to <a href="index.html#/battles/205">Vienna</a>, which they would
liberate 2 months after Budapest. </p>
