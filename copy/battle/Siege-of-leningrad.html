<p>Axis forces surrounded Leningrad on September 8th 1941. Moving through the Baltic states and capturing the city
was the German North Army Group's main objective during Operation Barbarossa.
They easily advanced through The Baltics however, Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von
Leeb was forced to encircle Leningrad after Hitler diverted panzer tanks for an
assault on <a href="moscow.html">Moscow</a>. German
forces congregated in the south while <a href="war_against_finland.html">Finnish troops, fighting as part of the Continuation
War</a>, blocked the city from the north. Finland had reached most of their
Pre-Winter War borders by the end of summer 1941 and maintained the Siege of Leningrad as
a means to secure their territorial gains. There was very little shelling from
the Finnish side and virtually no coordination between Nazi and Finnish forces.
The Nazis frequently bombed and shelled the city, killing over 4,400 civilians in air raids in  September 1941 alone. As time went on, food became extremely rare and those that did not die
from starvation suffered from severe malnutrition. </p>

<p>The Red Army made a small breach in the siege on January 18th 1943, allowing
some supplies to enter Leningrad and for limited civilian evacuations over the
frozen Lake Lagoda. The unstable ice made crossing the lake dangerous and out of the approximately 1 million people  evacuated from the city, tens of thousands are estimated to have died. The siege was
officially broken on January 27th 1944, when Soviet forces pushed German troops
out of the vicinity of the city. Finland retreated later that summer.</p>

<p>The Siege of Leningrad was one of the most destructive military events in
history. It lasted for 2 years, 4 months, 2 weeks, and 5 days (popularly known as the 900 days). Over a million
Red Army soldiers died defending the city or trying to break the siege.
Between 800,000 and 1 million civilians perished  during the siege and evacuation of the city, primarily from hunger.</p>
