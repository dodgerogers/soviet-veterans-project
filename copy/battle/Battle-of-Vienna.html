<p>Vienna was briefly under siege but since few German troops remained in the city at that  point, The Red Army was able to capture it relatively quickly.
The lack of German troops meant that some areas had heavy resistance and urban 
combat while there was virtually no fighting in others. The city was firmly
 under Soviet control less than 2 weeks after the battle began. Some soldiers retreated to Linz and Graz, where they 
were defeated before the end of April.</p>
