<p>The Liberation of Riga was part of a larger Baltic Offensive launched by the
Red Army in late 1944. Building off the success of Operation Bagration in the
summer, which cleared German troops out of Belarus, The Red Army continued
moving north. A smaller, southward moving force that had just liberated Estonia
was also advancing towards Latvia. Soviet forces began bombarding the city on  September 17th, and the German retreat began on September 26th. The Red Army had cut off the Baltic states from  the rest of Europe by October 10th. The final German retreat from  Riga began October 6th, and they had completely exited the city by  the 12th, but these troops were unable to return to Germany. Soviet  troops entered Riga on October 13th.

<p>The Soviet troops in the south fought through most of Latvia, culminating in The
Battle of Memel from October 5th-22nd 1944. They forced the remaining Axis forces into
The Kurland Pocket, cutting them off from the rest of the army, where they continued to fight until the formal  end of the war in May 1945. Both the
northern and southern marching Soviet forces are credited with liberating
Latvia, though only a portion of the soldiers were actually in Riga. </p>
