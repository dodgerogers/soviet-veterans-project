<p>Nazi Germany invaded The Soviet Union on June 22nd 1941. Though World War Two began in September 1939, the two countries signed a non-aggression pact called the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in August 1939. Stalin was unprepared for war, relying on Hitler to keep the pact while engaged in The Winter War with Finland (1939-40), border skirmishes with the Japanese (Khalkhin Gol 1939), and <a href="index.html#/battles/209">internal military purges.</a></p>

<p>Though many assumed Germany would invade, The Red Army was far from ready. The German army march into Russia, codenamed 'Operation Barbarossa', leveled cities and occupied Belarus, Moldova, parts of Ukraine, Soviet controlled parts of Poland, and The Baltic States (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia). The Germans also laid siege to Leningrad before their advance stopped at <a href="index.html#/battles/201">Moscow</a> and <a href="index.html#/battles/203">Stalingrad</a> in December 1941.</p>
