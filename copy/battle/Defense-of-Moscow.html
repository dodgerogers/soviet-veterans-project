<p>Initially, Moscow was not the prime  objective of Operation Barbarossa. There was disagreement between Hitler and  his generals over the ultimate aims—both agreed that defeating the Soviets was  the main goal, but Hitler also valued capturing economic resources, while  Chief of Staff Franz Halder wanted to push to Moscow to destroy morale and  prevent the Soviets’ capacity to resist. “The Defense of Moscow”, lasting from October  1941 to April 1942, refers to the German offensive targeting the city—known  as Operation Typhoon—and the subsequent Soviet counterattacks. The Nazis anticipated their entire invasion of  the USSR would be successfully concluded before winter began in 1941. Though they were able to advance deep into Soviet 
Territory, the German army used considerably more resources than expected. They 
were also unprepared for the harsh Soviet winter.</p>

<p>By November 1941 a large amount of German equipment was rendered unusable due  to weather conditions and they were stretched well beyond the limits of their supply lines. In contrast, The Red Army was also taking heavy losses but was able to replenish their supplies. Soviet forces launched a counter offensive in December of 1941, aided by freezing weather and an exhausted enemy. The  Soviet counteroffensive that ultimately pushed  the Germans out of Moscow began in early January. The battle was costly for both sides, with the Nazis suffered 615,000 dead and wounded soldiers compared to near 2.5 million from The Red Army. Though far from a decisive victory, The Red Army effectively stopped the German advance into Russia, setting up a longer war of attrition on the eastern front, which Germany lacked the resources and troops to  sustain. The successful defense of Moscow also raised Soviet morale and was used throughout the war in propaganda material. </p>
