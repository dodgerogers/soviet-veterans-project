<p>Tensions between The Soviet Union and Japan can be traced to the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. Japan was part of a coalition of countries that occupied Vladikostok from 1918-1922 and only formally recognized The Soviet Union in 1925. The Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931 and established a puppet state called Manchukuo in 1932, encroaching if not crossing the Soviet border. This lead to the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938, where no territory changed hands but animosity lingered after a month of fighting and posturing.</p>

<p>The Battle of Khalkhin Gol from May to September 1939 was more significant. It started with a border skirmish in Siberia, and resulted in the Japanese being severely defeated by Soviet forces. The Red Army was commanded by General <a href="index.html#/veterans/46">Georgy Zhukov</a>, who debuted techniques against the Japanese that would later be successful against the Germans in World War Two. The resounding defeat at Khalkhin Gol motivated Japan into singing a nonaggression pact with The Soviet Union in 1941.</p>

<p>Stalin promised the other allied leaders at The Yalta Conference in February 1945 that he would attack Japan once Germany surrendered. The Soviet Union invaded Manchuria on August 9th of that year and remained in Japanese territory until September 2nd. Soviet forces liberated Pyongyang and occupied the northern half of the Korean Peninsula, leading to the Korean War with the American held south in 1950.</p>
