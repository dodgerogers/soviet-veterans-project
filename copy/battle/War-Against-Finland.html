<p>The Soviet Union was involved in two separate conflicts with Finland during the Second World War. The Winter War from November 1939 - March 1940 and The Continuation War From June 1941 - September 1944. The Continuation War forced The Red Army to divert resources to the northeast during World War Two and provided incentive for Finland to work with Germany in <a href="index.html#/battles/200">The Siege of Leningrad</a> and other situations on the eastern front.</p>

<p>The wars were fought over territory near Leningrad that was part of Russia before the revolution but was lost when Finland declared independence in 1917. The Winter War began when Soviet forces invaded Finland in November 1939. The Soviets had more men and vehicles but were unorganized due to <a href="index.html#/battles/211">Stalin's purge of military leadership in 1936</a>. The invasion was condemned by The League Of Nations, though Finland received humanitarian aid from the US, but no international military support. The Finns lasted longer than expected but were forced to cede valuable territory in The Moscow Peace Treaty after 105 days of fighting.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union considered The Continuation War part of the Great Patriotic War against Germany and its allies while Finland viewed it as a separate military engagement. Finland tightened diplomatic relations with Germany between wars, hoping to gain back territory lost in The Winter War. Hostilities resumed on June 25th, 1941 after the Nazis invaded The Soviet Union on June 22nd. Though Finland did support the Germans in conducting the <a href="index.html#/battles/200">Siege of Leningrad</a> they were significantly less brutal than The Nazis and concentrated their efforts in the disputed Karelia Territory. The Continuation War is generally divided into 3 phases, the Finnish offensive, a stalemate or trench warfare portion, and a Soviet offensive.</p>

<p>Finland considered itself a co-belligerent with rather than an ally of Nazi Germany. They received tactical support in exchange for allowing German troops to operate within their borders. Finland began seeking an end to the war after Germany's loss at The <a href="index.html#/battles/203">Battle Of Stalingrad</a> in 1943. The Continuation War ended in September 1944 when an armistice was signed between Finland and the USSR. The war formally concluded by the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty. Making peace with The Soviet Union created tension between Finland and The Nazis. This resulted in The Lapland War from 1944-45, between Finland and Germany.</p>
