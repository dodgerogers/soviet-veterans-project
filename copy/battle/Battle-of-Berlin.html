<p>The war's last major offensive lasted from April 16th to May 2nd 1945.
German forces collapsed inward to hold the city centre, leading 
to urban combat similar to <a href="index.html#/battles/203">The Battle of Stalingrad</a>. By this time, The
 German Army was severely depleted filling out ranks with those who were
considered too young or too old for combat only months earlier.</p>

<p>The Red Army captured The Reichstag (German Parliament) on April 30th.  Unable to escape, The Germans
 surrendered on May 2nd. Some soldiers continued fighting until the formal end
of the war on May 8th and others moved west to surrender to The Western Allies 
instead of The Red Army. </p>
