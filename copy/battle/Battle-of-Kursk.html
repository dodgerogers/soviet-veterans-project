<p>The Battle Of Kursk in July 1943 was the final  German offensive on The Russian Front, and was at one time considered to be the  largest tank battle in World War 2. After <a
href="index.html#/battles/201">Moscow</a> and <a
href="index.html#/battles/203">Stalingrad</a> a series of small Red Army
offensives had created a bulge in the German line near Kursk. A complete
breakthrough could have enabled them to surround the German forces. Having lost Kharkov
in February, the Germans planned a large offensive codenamed 'Operation
Citadel' with the hopes of regaining momentum and cutting off the Soviet troops stationed in  the bulge near Kursk. <a href="georgy_zhukov.html">Marshal
Zhukov</a> became aware of the massive amounts of German artillery gathering in
the area. He mobilized the civilian population to plant mines,
while correctly positioning anti tank units where the Germans would concentrate
their assault. The battle began on July 5th with several waves of German attacks, for the most part
being repelled by well prepared Soviet defenses. Both sides initiated strategic
bombing campaigns that developed into a simultaneous air war. Kursk marked the end of German air dominance on  the Eastern Front. The Germans were forced to retreat by the end
of August having failed to gain any ground. The loss was demoralizing for the Nazis and gave
The Red Army control over the eastern front, allowing them to shift to a purely
offensive mindset and begin the march towards Berlin.</p>

<p>The Battle of Kursk is the eastern front's equivalent to the western front's
more famous Battle of the Bulge in late 1944. Both marked the last time Germany
was able to mount an offensive in a particular area, with that attack's failure
cementing the allies' control. The Battle of Kursk is known for the large  number of tanks and artillery involved. The Nazis had 2,700 armoured vehicles (not all of  which were tanks), 9,470 artillery pieces and 1,372 aircraft. Of  the 2,465 armoured vehicles put into battle by the Germans on day 1, only 328  were modern battle tanks (Panzers and Tigers). Though the Red Army was better prepared for their  defense at Kursk than for previous battles, their victory was in large part due to their 
ability to outmatch the substantial German force with over 5,035 tanks and self-propelled guns committed to  action at Kursk. </p>
