<p>The People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs was a branch of The
Soviet Government, responsible for what we now call homeland security. Formed
in 1934, The NKVD is commonly referred to as Stalin's secret police department.
Though they had officers embedded in most government organizations, there were
also many public NKVD officials who worked cases openly, like a traditional
police department only with very little oversight or regulations. The NKVD ran
the gulag system (forced labour camps), conducted political executions in The
Soviet Union, and conducted domestic intelligence work to locate  perceived enemies of the USSR. The organization is closely associated with political
oppression. In 1945 it was reorganized into the MVD and became the KGB in 1954. </p>
