<p>The Doctor's Plot was the culmination of <a href="index.html#/stories/413">Stalin's</a> post war antisemitic policies. The plot, a conspiracy manufactured to implicate Soviet Jewish physicians, can be traced to Andrei Zhdanov's death in August 1948. Zhdanov was a high ranking party official and a close ally of Stalin's who succumbed to a heart attack. In 1952 high-ranking Soviet officials in Stalin's inner circle accused a group of mostly Jewish doctors of murdering Zhdanov as part of a Western-influenced plot to seize control of The Soviet Union. The conspiracy was based on a 1948 letter by Lidiia Timashuk, who was in charge of the Electrocardiography Laboratory at the Kremlin Hospital, warning Zhdanov's doctors were improperly diagnosing his condition. Timushek's accusations did not target Jewish doctors. In March 1951, well known Jewish physcician and <a href="index.html#/stories/403">JAC</a> member Yakov Eitinger died while being tortured in prison. His forced testimony alluded to a Jewish and American conspiracy to implicate murdering high ranking Soviet officials. By 1952 this testimony was used as the basis for arresting 37 other Jewish doctors and their immediate families on similar charges. Minister of State Security Viktor Abakumov was also arrested in late 1951 and accused of being a "Jewish sympathizer", leading to many Jewish MGB (State Security Ministry) employees being fired or arrested throughout 1952.</p>

<p>These arrests were accompanied by a media campaign reviving antisemitic rhetoric from The Protocols of the Elders of Zion in September 1952. This served as an endorsement of Anti Jewish policies throughout the Soviet Union, significantly affecting the quality of life for Jews throughout the country. <a href="index.html#/veterans/55">Solomon Mikhoels</a> reappeared in the press, positioned as a key player in a "rootless cosmopolitan", Zionist, or bourgeoisie plot to overthrown the Soviet Union by having Jewish doctors poison high ranking officials. The Doctor's Plot contributed to a brief severing of diplomatic ties with Israel in early 1953, but relations resumed after Stalin's death. The propaganda campaign continued into 1953. Many speculate that <a href="index.html#/veterans/50">Stalin</a> invented the plot to initiate another purge, <a href="index.html#/stories/413">similar to the one in 1936</a>, with the Jewish conspiracy filling the same justifying role as Sergey Kirov's murder. At the time there were also rumours that forced deportations of Soviet Jews were being organized, again using the Plot as justification, though no conclusive evidence to support this has come to light. After Stalin's death in March 1953, Soviet officials admitted no Doctor's Plot existed, though antisemitic policies lingered.</p>
