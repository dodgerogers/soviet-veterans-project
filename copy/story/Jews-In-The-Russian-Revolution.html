<p>Hundreds of years of Tsarist oppression left many Jews sympathetic to the revolutionary cause. The General Jewish Labour Bund (Bund) was a prominent workers organization among Jews in the Russian Empire, based in Lithuania, Poland and Belarus. In 1906 its Russian members were incorporated into The Menshevik Party, a leftist faction that opposed The Bolsheviks before the revolution in 1917. The Bund was the only Jewish group to work with Soviet organizers in The February Revolution of 1917. The group was initially against The Bolshevik lead October Revolution later that year. The Bund eventually endorsed The Bolshevik cause during The Russian Civil War amidst antisemitic policies and pogroms by White or Tsarist factions. Many Bund members joined the newly formed Red Army, fighting with The Bolsheviks. The Russian chapter of the group was officially disbanded in 1921 with most of its members joining The Communist Party. The Bund continued to function in Poland, which had become and independent country.</p>

<p>There were many Jewish Bolsheviks, though the party was internationally focused with a predominately secular outlook. Leon Trotsky was perhaps the most famous, he is credited with founding The Red Army and was arguably second to Lenin in the early days of Bolshevik and Communist rule. Lev Kamenev, Grigory Zinoviev, and Yakov Sverdlov also held high ranking positions in The Bolshevik Party.</p>
