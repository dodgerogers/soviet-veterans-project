<p>Vladimir Lenin became one of the first world leaders to openly denounce antisemitism in March 1918 in a speech called “On Anti Jewish Pogroms”. His regime did not endorse any religion but made a vocal stance against outward forms of hate. Lenin allowed Jews every freedom available. Anti-Semitism did not disappear during Lenin's time in power though he did significantly improve the quality of life for Jews in The Soviet Union. Many of the veterans acknowledge that no racial persecution existed in the army, but anti-Jewish sentiments lingered throughout Soviet society.</p>

<p>The 1920s and 30s were a good period for Jews in The Soviet Union, especially compared to life under the Tsar.</p>

<p>By secularizing Soviet society, laws against Jews were removed at the same time as laws favouring The Russian Orthodox Church. Improvements for Jewish people were a product of the regime's anti-religious point of view and only exist because the previous rulers targeted them specifically. Although Jews enjoyed equal rights under Communist rule, religious traditions were discouraged during the 1920s and many were targeted for discrimination or officially forbidden during the 1930s, making life more difficult for devoutly religious Jews.</p>
