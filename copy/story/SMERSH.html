<p>SMERSH was the military counter
intelligence branch of The Red Army from 1943-1946. SMERSH or “Death to Spies” was created to investigate and then eliminate Anti Soviet elements in
armed forces. Operatives were often embedded in Red Army units. Where the NKGB (The People’s Commissariat of State  Security) was tasked with international
espionage and worked outside of the army, SMERSH had a domestic focus and was
mostly contained to the military. It would investigate personnel and vet POWs,
locate deserters, and run counter espionage operations. Like the <a href="index.html#/stories/412">NKVD</a>, SMERSH developed a reputation
for brutal tactics. SMERSH operated in parallel to the Red Army but  outside its chain of command, led by Viktor Abakumov who reported directly to Stalin. In this way, SMERSH
became a means to enforce Stalinist policies under the pretense of security.

<p>While most counterintelligence organizations tended to focus on enemy
conspirators, SMERSH’s targets were often motivated by domestic  political concerns. SMERSH would accuse Red Army personnel of being Nazi sympathizers as
a means of justifying their removal from duty or even murder. Vadim J
Birnstein, one of the few scholars to have access to declassified documents in
the 1990s, estimates SMERSH affected the lives of millions of people. SMERSH  engaged in torture, intelligence gathering and sanctioned killings. In the middle of the
deadliest war in Soviet history, SMERSH became another threat to most Red Army
soldiers. </p>
