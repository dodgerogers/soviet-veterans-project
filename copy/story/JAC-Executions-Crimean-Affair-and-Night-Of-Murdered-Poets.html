<p><a href="index.html#/stories/403">Jewish Anti Fascist Committee (JAC)</a> members were arrested and charged with treason starting in late 1948. They were accused of trying to establish a Jewish state in Crimea that would be loyal to Soviet enemies, in what became known as “The Crimean Affair”. “The Night of the Murdered Poets” refers to the execution of 13 Jewish artists, academics, and politicians on August 12th 1952, all charged in conjunction with “The Crimean Affair”. Soviet authorities would use the Crimean story to prosecute another 110 Jews before the end of Stalin's reign in 1953, 10 were sentenced to death and the rest to hard labour. Everyone implicated in “The Crimean Affair” was rehabilitated in 1955 and The Soviet Union admitted to fabricating all the charges in 1989.</p>

<p>13 of the 15 high profile Jews first sentenced to death in “The Crimean Affair” died on “The Night of the Murdered Poets”. All of them were in someway connected to The JAC. Yiddish poets Peretz Markish, David Hofstein, Itzik Fefer, and Leib Kvitko were killed along with, Benjamin Zuskin, Solomon Mikhoels' successor as head of the Moscow State Yiddish Theatre. Fefer was a prominent JAC supporter who traveled to America on JAC’s behalf along with Mikhoels, during which time he was photographed with Mikhoels alongside Einstein.. Novelist David Bergelson, translators Leon Talmi, Emilia Teumin, and Khaya Vatenburg-Ostrovskaya, her husband, journalist Ilya Vatenberg and historian and trade unionist Joseph Yuzefovich were also shot after being accused of treason. Prominent medical doctor Boris Shimeliovich was also tried and killed. Even after being tortured, Shimeliovich never confessed to a single accusation. Solomon Lozovsky, former director of the Soviet Information Bureau and Deputy Commissar of Foreign Affairs, was technically the highest ranking victim and the most vocal in his defense. Solomon Bregman was Deputy minister of state control of the Russian Federation scheduled to die with the group of 'murdered poets' but fell into a coma and passed away in jail. Lina Stern, a leading Soviet scientist, was tried and convicted but her research was deemed too important to the state and she was spared execution.</p>
