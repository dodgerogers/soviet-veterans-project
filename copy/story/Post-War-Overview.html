<p>There was a dramatic increase in Soviet antisemitism after the war.  Many Jewish veterans had a difficult time finding work, receiving medical treatment, and some felt they were denied medals.  Life had been better for Jews under <a href="http://sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/402">Communism</a> compared to The <a href="http://sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/400">Tsar</a>.  <a href="http://sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/401">The Bolsheviks</a> initially muted Russia&#39;s systemic anti-Jewish mentality by avoiding or prohibiting all religions, instead of rehabilitating the cultural image of Jewishness.  <a href="http://sovietjewishveterans.com/#/veterans/50">Stalin</a> revived latent ideas of Jews as parasites by rhetorically aligning them with The USSR&#39;s new cold war enemies, effectively making Jews a scapegoat for post war domestic issues.  It&#39;s telling that Stalin initially supported the idea of a Jewish state but changed his mind when Israel aligned itself with The United States.  Many point to <a href="http://sovietjewishveterans.com/#/veterans/55">Solomon Mikhoels&#39;</a> murder in 1948 as a turning point, when Soviet antisemitism reverted back to violent persecution from more subtle forms of bureaucratic discrimination.  Golda Meir&#39;s visit to Moscow that same year is also held up as a pivotal moment.  Stalin viewed the support for Meir as a threat to his own power and subsequently increased pressure on organizations like the <a href="http://sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/403">JAC</a>.  Stalin&#39;s post war attacks on Soviet Jews culminated in <a href="http://sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/404">The Night Of Murdered Poets</a> and <a href="http://sovietjewishveterans.com/#/stories/405">The Doctors Plot.</a></p>
