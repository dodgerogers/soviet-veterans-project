<p>There had been a long history of violence against Jews in Tsarist Russia, particularly in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Peter The Great prohibited Jews from immigrating into the country in the early 1700s saying, “They are rogues and cheats. It is my endeavor to eradicate evil, not to multiply it”. In 1772 Catherine The Great placed restrictions on where the Jews living in Russia could settle. Tsars kept similar limitations on Jewish migrations in place until the fall of the Romanov Dynasty in 1917.</p>

<p>One of the earliest pogroms against Russian Jews took place in Odessa in 1821. Anti-Jewish violence was then ignored if not fostered by the government and Russian Orthodox Church, particularly in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. And following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II a wave of pogroms erupted throughout the country lasting from 1881-1882. Another wave of more deadly pogroms began in 1903 in Kishinev, and continued through the Russian Revolution of 1905. More than 2 million Jews chose to emigrate from Russia in the years leading up to the First World War, pushed to leave by a combination of violence and economic hardship within Russia, and enticed by the promise of greater freedom and financial opportunity elsewhere.</p>
