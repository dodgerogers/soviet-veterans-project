<p>The Jewish Anti Fascist Committee (JAC) was founded in March 1942 as a cooperative effort between Jewish community leaders and The Soviet Government. It was designed to promote The Soviet Union around the world and raise money for the war effort. Popular actor and Director of the Moscow State Yiddish Theatre, <a href="index.html#/veterans/55">Solomon Mikhoels</a> was its first chairman. Other notable members included writers Itzik Fefer, Shakhne Epstein ,Leib Kvitko, Peretz Markish, David Hofstein, Ilya Ehrenburg, Joseph Yuzefovich, Isaak Nusinov, David Bergelson, Ilya Vatenberg, Khaya Vatenberg-Ostrovskaya, Emilia Teumin, and Leon Talmy. Scientists Lina Stern and Boris Shimeliovich also joined along with Shlomo Shlifer, The Chief Rabbi of Moscow. Several JAC members held important government posts like Head of the Soviet Information Bureau Solomon Lozovsky and Deputy Minister of State Control of the Russian Federation Solomon Bregman. Israel Fisanovich, a renowned submarine commander who would be named Hero of the Soviet Union in 1942, General Aaron Katz, who was in charge of the Stalin Military Academy, and Lieutenant General Yakov Kreizer, the first General to receive a Hero of the Soviet Union award during World War II, were among the The JAC's highest ranking military officials.</p>

<p>The JAC published a newspaper called Eynikayt (Yiddish for unity) up to three times a week, promoting Jewish life in The USSR and decrying notions of antisemitism. Eynikayt became an important link between Soviet Jews and the JAC. It published articles that highlighted the Jewish contribution to the Soviet war effort, as well as many letters sent to the newspaper by enthusiastic readers. In May 1942, the JAC broadcast a series of speeches from Moscow, calling on Jewish communities outside of the Soviet Union to make donations to the Red Army and pressure their governments into joining the fight against Nazism.</p>

<p>JAC fundraising was very successful. They raised 3,300,000 rubles (roughly 660,000 USD) for the war effort domestically. Mikhoels and Fefer were sent on an international fundraising tour later that year, becoming the first Soviet Jews to make contact on behalf on an official Jewish organization with communities outside Russia since 1917. They were warmly received in The US, Canada, Britain, and Mexico, proudly speaking about Jewish life in The Soviet Union and the dangers of Nazism. On July 8th they spoke to a crowd of over 50, 000 people at The Polo Grounds in New York. It was the largest pro Soviet rally on US soil. While touring America, Mikhoels and Fefer met with Fiorello La Guardia, Sholem Asch, Chaim Weizmann, Charlie Chaplin, Marc Chagall, Paul Robeson, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Albert Einstein. The Soviet newspaper Pravda reported that their visit to Chicago sparked a campaign to finance ambulances for The Red Army. In total they raised over $10 million in America.</p>

<p>The relationship between the JAC and Soviet authorities soured after the war. During peacetime the government was less lenient towards religious expression and the committee was focusing on publications that specifically promoted a Jewish point of view. The JAC, which was originally founded as a Soviet propaganda organization, began challenging the state's official message. In 1942 they conceived of the idea of The Black Book, a collection of testimonies describing Nazi atrocities against Jews in occupied Soviet territory. They worked on collecting material for this during and immediately after the war. Despite being edited by leading journalists Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman, The Black Book was ultimately banned by Soviet censors before it could be published. The Soviet government never denied The Holocaust outright but certainly minimized the extent of the genocide and suppressed the idea that specific ethnic groups were treated differently than others. An American edition of The Black Book appeared in 1946 with a forward by Albert Einstein and a Hebrew version was printed in Israel in 1980. The JAC were also working on The Red Book about Jewish contributions to The Soviet War effort, which was never finished. The committee lobbied the government against emerging antisemitism in hiring practices, the awarding of medals, and the refusal to investigate crimes with Jewish victims. They worked with returning veterans who were having difficulty finding work, medical treatment, and their families.</p>

<p>Many point to Golda Meir's September 1948 visit to Moscow as the turning point in <a href="index.html#/veterans/50">Stalin's</a> attitude towards the JAC. Though he had yet to officially change his position on Israel, thousands of people rallying in Moscow for something other than The Soviet Union presented a threat to the uniformity his control was predicated on Stalin had hoped that people in Israel would support the USSR; instead, Soviet citizens were demonstrating loyalty towards Israel. Mikhoels had already been murdered in January but the committee was allowed to continue and his death was officially called a car accident. After Meir's visit Soviet authorities began arresting JAC members and charging them in conjunction with <a href="/index.html#/stories/404">"The Crimean Affair"</a>. The committee was officially closed in November 1948 with most of its members in jail by the end of January 1949. Many of those arrested after Meir's visit were killed in <a href="/index.html#/stories/404">"The Night of Murdered Poets"</a> in 1952. Ilya Ehrenburg was the only prominent JAC member to escape jail and execution, because his war reporting had made him incredibly famous and popular throughout the USSR after WWII (not just within the Jewish community), and because he had always been less involved in the JAC than the others, even critical of them at times.</p>
