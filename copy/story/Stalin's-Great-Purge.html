<p>Between 1936 and 1939 Joseph Stalin initiated a campaign of political, economic, and ideological repression against perceived domestic enemies. Sometimes called 'The Great Terror' this repression manifested in arrests on false charges, as well as a propaganda campaign legitimizing Stalin's actions, and by extension his leadership. Though Lenin also used the tactics of terror and mass arrests to consolidate his power before Stalin, The Great Purge is unique for targeting members of the ruling Communist Party. The murder, imprisonment, or banishment of many prominent officials and generals left The Soviet Union unprepared for war with Germany.</p>

<p>Stalin used the 1934 murder of Leningrad Party Leader Sergei Kirov as justification for the purge. Kirov was a Stalin loyalist and popular within the party. Stalin took advantage of the murder of Kirov, using the assassination as evidence of the existence of a network of internal enemies. The first show trials centered on Kirov's murder began in 1936. Prominent defendants like <a href="index.html#/stories/402">Grigory Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, and Leon Trotsky</a>, who was tried in abstentia, were accused in a public hearing of a conspiracy to kill Stalin and take power. Everyone was found guilty, despite outside observers citing factual inconsistencies. The show trials proved to be an effective way to discredit and remove longstanding and influential Party members (Old Bolsheviks). Similar trials continued until 1939, the most famous occurring in 1938 when Nikolai Bukharin was among the 21 former high ranking communists found guilty of plotting against Stalin. Bukharin, like other former leading Bolsheviks, confessed after being tortured. The <a href="index.html#/stories/412">NKVD</a> would routinely torture suspects, forcing confessions and sometimes threatening or arresting the accused's family members. The hunt for enemies eventually caused the NKVD to turn on its own employees. Former leaders Genrikh Yagoda and Nikolai Yezhov were both arrested. Yagoda was tried and killed in 1938; Yezhov suffered the same fate in 1940.</p>

Mikhail Tukhachevsky</i></p>

<p>The highest officials of the Soviet General Staff, including three of the five Marshals who held that rank in 1937 were killed during the purge, significantly weakening The Red Army's ability to prepare and orchestrate a large scale war. Marshal Vasily Blyukher was killed in 1938, Aleksandr Yegorov in 1939, and Mikhail Tukhachevsky in 1937. Though all 3 were innocent, Tukhachevsky is significant because he was credited with modernizing The Red Army after the revolution. His theory of “Deep Operations” was adopted with great success by <a href="index.html#/veterans/46">Gerogy Zhukov</a> at <a href="index.html#/battles/209">Khalklin Gol</a> and throughout the eastern front in World War II. Tukhachevsky's methods were mocked during his show trial. All 3 generals were rehabilitated by The Soviet Union in 1957. Between one quarter and half of the active Red Army Officers were killed during The Great Purge.</p>

<p>Though many of the documents pertaining to The Great Purge remain classified some figures have been made public. 1.4 million people were convicted in <a href="index.html#/stories/412">NKVD</a> investigations, of which 687,000 were shot..</p>
